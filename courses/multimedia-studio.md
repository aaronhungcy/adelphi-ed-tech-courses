## Description
How can the digital media best support learning? Working on
semester-long projects, students learn about interaction and
instructional design. In this hands-on studio, develop and extend skills
in multimedia authoring: digital images/audio/video, web design,
HTML/CSS/Javascript, web programming. Apply these skills to create a
original educational resources.

Each semester will feature a different challenge, dealing with an
important, global topic. Students will be asked to work on a semester
long multimedia project that teaches some aspect of this challenge. The
semester will culminate with a student show, which will be refereed by a
panel of experts in the field of educational technology.

Since I started thinking about this course in Fall 2010, I have thought about what topics would make good subjects. Here is what I've been thinking about:

* Fall 2010: Teaching the BP Oil Spill
* Spring 2011: Wikileaks: diplomacy, journalism, and the internet
* Fall 2011: The Arab Spring
* Spring 2012: #Occupy

All final projects will be published on the Program in Educational Technology website, and will be released under an appropriate open license that allows reuse and remix (GPL for code, CC for creative works, for example).

## Goals
This course is designed to challenge students to develop their abilities
as instructional designers and as authors and producers of digital media
for learning. Specifically, they should learn to:

-   design an effective digital learning environment that is intuitive
    to use and follows principles of Universal Design for Learning
-   develop in-depth skill in one area of digital production: video
    editing, graphic design, game design, computer programming, web
    design, etc.
-   understand key concepts of instructional design, including meeting
    the needs of the target audience and following sound and ethical
    pedagogical principles
-   think creatively about far-reaching challenges in teaching and
    learning

## Class sessions
*The sessions below are examples of how the course might unfold, but
because of the nature of the studio, the instructor may choose to cover
other areas or change the order of studios in response to student needs.
The seminars are expected to remain as planned.*

### Welcome: introduction to studio pedagogy
The introductory session introduces the idea and background of a studio
pedagogy, and explains how the course will unfold.

*Readings due: Collins; Kuhn*

### Studio: digital images
This studio focuses on manipulating and using digital images; students
will learn techniques of the Gimp image editing software.

### Seminar: interaction design
Seminar about the key principles of interface and interaction design.

*Readings due: Moggridge, ch 1,5,7,10*

### Studio: introduction to web development
Covers the basic building blocks of Web design and development: HTML and
CSS.

### Studio: web layouts and media
Students learn more advanced web techniques, with a focus on HTML5 and
multimedia.

### Seminar: learning with multimedia
Seminar covers the key concepts of learning with multimedia; exploring
powerful examples of multimedia learning resources.

*Readings due: Jewitt; Moggridge, ch 8*

### Studio: web interactivity with Javascript
Students learn to make interactive web pages using the Javascript
programming language.

### Studio: GIS - geograhic information systems
This studio looks at the tools for integrating geographic systems into
educational media.

### mid-point critique
All students present their work to the class, formal critique from
instructor and peers.

### Studio: blogs & wikis
This session focses on using wikis (MediaWiki) and blogs (WordPress) as
multimedia frameworks.

### Studio: video basics
In this studio, students experiment with the basics of shooting video
(lighting, camera angles, scripting, framing shots).

### Studio: video editing
Students will work with non-linear video editing packages (e.g. Final
Cut).

### Studio: audio
Students are introduced to the concepts of audio editing/sampling; they
will use the Audacity software package.

### Final show
Students prepare an open studio, where they will present their project
to the jury and guests from campus and community (and online).

## Assignments
The studio format allows for frequent and ongoing evaluation of the
student work. An important aspect will be invited guests who will also
come into the studio to consult with students and to offer informal
feedback. There will be formal mid-point and final critiques. The
mid-point critique will be conducted by the instructor and a guest; the
final assessment will consist of a panel of distinguished judges from
Adelphi University and outside organizations.

-   initial proposal (15%)
-   mid-term critique (20%)
-   final project (65%)

The critiques will consider the following criteria:

### Design
The design of the project encompasses the information, interaction, and
media design. Points to consider when evaluating the design:

-   is the navigation consistent, logical, and easily understood?
-   does the graphic design engage users?
-   does the look and feel support the learning goals of the project?
-   does the user interface take advantage of existing conventions, UI
    widgets, and user patterns?
-   are there clear paths through the system to accomplish user goals?
-   are system messages and instructions consistent and clear?
-   does the overall design exhibit a level of professionalism and
    polish that supports trust by the user?
-   is the design accessible?
    -   does it support the widest possible range of computer systems
        (including OS, web browser, screen size/mobile, processor speed,
        internet connection quality)
    -   can it be accessed by users with disabilities, where
        appropriate?

### Technique
The project's technique reflects the proficiency of the teams with the
tools of the digital studio. All aspects of the project should be well
tested for smooth operation. Users should not easily "break" the system.
The specifics of development depend on the media. So, each of the
various skills required for the course will be evaluated based on the
practice of expert practitioners.

-   is video composed and edited like an expert video?
-   does software meet the speed and reliability that an expert would
    expect?
-   etc.

### Originality & innovation
Teams will gain points based on the originality of their project. Does
the project take a novel approach to teaching with digital media? Does
it combine existing practices in new ways, for a new effect?

Students will lose points in originality for verbatim translating of
existing learning solutions to the new problem space.

### Learning science
At the end, this studio challenge is about learning. Points in this
category are awarded for exhibiting a thorough understanding of how
people learn with digital artifacts. Successful projects will account
for the cognitive, social, pragmatic, ethical, and aesthetic
implications of their design, as it impacts learning.
