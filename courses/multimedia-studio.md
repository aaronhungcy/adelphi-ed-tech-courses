**Keywords:** studio pedagogy, interaction design, multimedia 
learning, digital studio, ed tech capstone, instructional design

**Description:** How can digital media best support learning? 
Working on semester-long projects, students learn about interaction 
and instructional design. In this hands-on studio, develop and 
extend skills in multimedia authoring: digital images/audio/video, 
and interactive web development. Apply these skills to create a 
original educational resources.

## Spring 2013 Studio: Debt
![The Spring 2013 Studio Topic is "Debt".](http://matt.curinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/debt-222x300.png)

Each semester will feature a different challenge, dealing with an
important, global topic. Students will be asked to work on a semester
long multimedia project that teaches some aspect of this challenge. The
semester will culminate with a student show, which will be refereed by a
panel of experts in the field of educational technology.

Debt is one of the defining characteristics of our times. Student 
debt in the U.S. has passed the one trillion dollar mark.
[According to BusinessWeek](http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-09-12/underwater-mortgages-declined-in-2nd-quarter) 
“underwater” mortgages (where the value of a home is lower than 
mortgage) account for about “10.8 million properties — about 22 of 
all U.S. homes with a mortgage.” Cities are cutting community and 
social services while increasing spending on debt services. 
Americans are almost [$20 billion behind in paying back their 
credit card debt](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/problems-riddle-moves-to-collect-credit-card-debt).

This studio challenges students to create multimedia learning 
artifacts that explore the history and contemporary issues 
surrounding debt.

## Goals
This course is designed to challenge students to develop their abilities
as instructional designers and as authors and producers of digital media
for learning. Specifically, they should learn to:

-   design an effective digital learning environment that is intuitive
    to use and follows principles of Universal Design for Learning
-   develop in-depth skill in one area of digital production: video
    editing, graphic design, game design, computer programming, web
    design, etc.
-   understand key concepts of instructional design, including meeting
    the needs of the target audience and following sound and ethical
    pedagogical principles
-   think creatively about far-reaching challenges in teaching and
    learning

_This is a tentative list and schedule of workshops. The actual 
studio will be organized to be responsive to the needs of the students._

## Assignments
The studio format allows for frequent and ongoing evaluation of the
student work. An important aspect will be invited guests who will also
come into the studio to consult with students and to offer informal
feedback. There will be formal mid-point and final critiques. The
mid-point critique will be conducted by the instructor and a guest; the
final assessment will consist of a panel of distinguished judges from
Adelphi University and outside organizations.

### Grading & due dates

Session   Assignment due       % of final grade
--------  -----------------    ----------------
 3        initial proposal        15%
 9        mid-term critique       20%
16        final project           65%

Projects will be evaluated using the following criteria.

### Design
The design of the project encompasses the information, interaction, and
media design. Points to consider when evaluating the design:

-   is the navigation consistent, logical, and easily understood?
-   does the graphic design engage users?
-   does the look and feel support the learning goals of the project?
-   does the user interface take advantage of existing conventions, UI
    widgets, and user patterns?
-   are there clear paths through the system to accomplish user goals?
-   are system messages and instructions consistent and clear?
-   does the overall design exhibit a level of professionalism and
    polish that supports trust by the user?
-   is the design accessible?
    -   does it support the widest possible range of computer systems
        (including OS, web browser, screen size/mobile, processor speed,
        internet connection quality)
    -   can it be accessed by users with disabilities, where
        appropriate?

### Technique
The project's technique reflects the proficiency of the teams with the
tools of the digital studio. All aspects of the project should be well
tested for smooth operation. Users should not easily "break" the system.
The specifics of development depend on the media. So, each of the
various skills required for the course will be evaluated based on the
practice of expert practitioners.

-   is video composed and edited like an expert video?
-   does software meet the speed and reliability that an expert would
    expect?
-   etc.

### Originality & innovation
Teams will gain points based on the originality of their project. Does
the project take a novel approach to teaching with digital media? Does
it combine existing practices in new ways, for a new effect?

Students will lose points in originality for verbatim translating of
existing learning solutions to the new problem space.

### Learning science
At the end, this studio challenge is about learning. Points in this
category are awarded for exhibiting a thorough understanding of how
people learn with digital artifacts. Successful projects will account
for the cognitive, social, pragmatic, ethical, and aesthetic
implications of their design, as it impacts learning.
