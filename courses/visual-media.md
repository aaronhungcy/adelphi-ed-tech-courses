Course Format
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an online cycle course, which will be primarily conducted using
the course Moodle site. **Students are required** to check Moodle
and class email at least once a day during the Cycle 2 dates. The course
will operate on a Friday-Friday schedule, all work due for a given
week _must_ be completed by end of day on Friday of that week.

As this is a Cylce course, it will be faster paced and more condensed
than a traditional 15-week semester course. Students _must_ budget
their time accordingly. Generally, the expectation is that students
will spend the following amount of time for each week of the course:

* 4 hours: instruction
  - reading instructor posts
  - watching instructor video
  - posting/commenting on online forums
  - uploading video/audio comments
* 4 hours: reading, this is a theorertical course and we will engage
  closely with the literature
* 3 hours: writing and media production

Technical competencies for participation in an online course:

- advanced use of Moodle including, uploading files, posting and 
  commenting on discussion forums, completing online timed assessments,
  etc.
- use of Adelphi domain Google Docs/Google Drive
  * sharing documents with classmates
  * using Google Doc comment feature
  * tracking revision history through Google docs

Assignments and Grading
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Educational Media Studio (50%)

Working from a visuality and media literacy perspective, students
will develop a substantial educational media project with explicit
instructional value. Students will choose their own audience for this
work: both the target age and ability level, as well as the domain
and content for instruction.

Regardless of the content, the work _must_ pay explicit attention to
the aesthetic and semantic content of the work, beyond the instructional
value.

Acceptable media or this project include:

* original digital or analog games for learning
* websites, web applications, or mobile (web) apps
* interactive SMARTBoard lessons
* original instructional video or audio (video can be animated, live
  action, screencasts, or a combination)
  
Along with the educational media, each student will turn in a 500
word reflection where they indicate the goals of their project in
terms of visual culture and media literacy, and discuss their
successes and difficulties in meeting these goals.

### Visuality in Educational Media (50%)

Students will choose a work of educational media and write a critique
based on the course readings. The essay should connect to the
visuality of course themes, as they are represented in the media
being studied. Themes include:

* media and violence
* bodies and difference
* visuality of power, coloniality, and empire
* markets, attention, and visual media
* mediation

This assignment must be between 4,000 and 5,000 words, and be written
following the style and citation format of the APA.
