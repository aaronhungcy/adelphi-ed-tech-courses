**Computer Science 0145-602, Fall 2013**

**Keywords:**  computer programming, CS1, python, computational thinking, 
critical computational literacy

**Description:** This course introduces students to programming and 
some core concepts of computer science, using a modern, object oriented
programming language (currently Python). Students learn concepts of 
variables, functions, repetition/loops, basic data structures 
(arrays, lists, hashtables), and basic object oriented programming.

Class meetings
--------------------------------------------------------

Introduction to computer programming meets every Tuesday, 4:30-6:20 in Harvey 104.
All students are expected to come on time and prepared for class. You may bring your
own laptop to class, or use one of the lab computers for your work. If you need
source files to work on in class

Assignmnet              Pct
-------------------     -------
Quizzes                 20%

Project 2               25%
Project 3               35%


Quizzes
--------------------------------------------------------

There will be 10 pass/fail quizzes which will be completed individually at
the start of class. Quizzes consist of 3-5 short answer programming questions drawn
directly from the reading for the week. Quizzes are designed to be passed easily by
students who are keeping up with the reading and the concepts in the course, and 
will help students and the instructor maintain a good pace for the development of the course.


Programming projects
--------------------------------------------------------

You will complete three programming projects, of increasing complexity, as the major
portions of your course.


Project 1: Facebook Status
---------------------------------------------

You will write a program to categorize Facebook status posts as either "happy" or "sad".

**Programming competencies:**
* input
	- use variables as input to the program and functions
* output
	- use ``print()`` to display output to the user
	- display output in intuitive and useful ways
* variables
	- use ``string`` and ``int`` variables to hold data
* math
	- increment and decrement counters
	- find averages
	- make numerical comparisons
* conditions
	- test for equality
	- match strings
* style/readability
	- variable names
	- comments
	- doc strings
	- white space
* functions
	- use functions to organize the program and make it more readable
	- use functions for repeated operations
	

Project 2: Text Analysis
---------------------------------------------



Project 3: Refactoring
---------------------------------------------

Choose either project 1 or project 2 and make an advanced, fully functional version,
where you demonstrate all of the programming and computer science competencies
