Programming Lab
==========================================================================================

Every week the teaching assistant will host a programming lab/workshop. It is highly
recommended that you attend every lab session. The TA will lead you through sample
problems very similar to what will be on the quizzes, will help debug/troubleshoot
your code, and will 

Assignments and Grading

Computational Thinking Dicussion Leader
--------------------------------------------------------

Each student will take a turn leading a discussion about an area
of topical interest related to computational thinking and computational
literacy. As the leader, you may, optionally, send out a short reading
to the class on the discussion as background reading.

When you lead the discussion, be prepared to:

1. introduce the topic with relevant information
2. describe why you think it is an important issue
3. discuss how it is related to computational literacy
4. facilitate a 10-15 minute discussion with the class

This assignment can be completed individually or in teams of 2.

Here are a few potential topics, to give you a sense of themes
for this assignment:

- changes to friendship, love, and other social relationships in the age
  of Facebook and other social media
- use of data encryption
- the split-attention and distraction caused by text messages, twitter, etc.
- role of universities and faculty/professors given a (possible)
  abundance of online learning opportunities like MOOCs, YouTube, Khan Academy, ...
- Wikipedia, knowledge, learning, etc.
- video games and their social effects
- the balance between security and privacy

Quizzes
--------------------------------------------------------

There will be 10 pass/fail quizzes which will be completed 
individually at the start of class. Quizzes consist of 3-5 short 
answer programming questions drawn directly from the reading for the 
week. Quizzes are designed to be passed easily by students who are 
keeping up with the reading and the concepts in the course, and will 
help students and the instructor maintain a good pace for the 
development of the course. _If you fail a quiz, you will be required
to attend the programming lab on Thursdays until you pass your next
quiz._


Programming projects
--------------------------------------------------------

You will complete three programming projects, of increasing complexity, as the major
portions of your course.


### Project 1: Facebook Status

You will write a program to categorize Facebook status posts as either "happy" or "sad".

**Programming competencies:**

* input
    - use variables as input to the program and functions
* output
    - use ``print()`` to display output to the user
    - display output in intuitive and useful ways
* variables
    - use ``string`` and ``int`` variables to hold data
* math
    - increment and decrement counters
    - find averages
    - make numerical comparisons
* conditions
    - test for equality
    - match strings
* style/readability
    - variable names
    - comments
    - ``docstrings``
    - white space
* functions
    - use functions to organize the program and make it more readable
    - use functions for repeated operations
    

### Project 2: Text Analysis

For this project you will select a text or a collection of texts and write a program
that uses computation to analyze the texts. It is up to you to both select the texts
and to decide what type of analysis is "interesting."

In addition to improving on the programming competencies from project 1, you should
demonstrate the following in your code:

**Programming competencies:**

* functions
    - abstraction through function parameters
    - encapsulation through function parameters and return statements; zero-side effects
    - _higher order function strategies_
    - _recursion_
* data structures
    - use python built-in data structures appropriately: ``list``, ``dict``, ``tuple``, ``set``
    - use index/slice notation
    - sort data structures
    - _use list comprehensions_, _map()_, or _filter()_
* testing
    - write test code that helps validate your program
    - _use ``doctest`` or ``unittest`` frameworks
* libraries/modules
    - divide your code into more than one file/module
    - use import statements to work with Python's standard library

### Project 3: Refactoring & Visualization

For your final project, you can team up with one of your classmates to revisit and improve
your earlier code. In particular, you should make your code more robust, more flexible,
and improve your tests. You should explicitly write code that demonstrates your understanding
of ``abstraction``, ``encapsulation``, and ``algorithms``. In the final class meeting
you will present your project in class, and show the parts of your program that best
exemplify these concepts, as you understand them.

In addition to improving and expanding your existing code, you will add a graphical
visualization of your results using the a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) library. SVGs
are graphics files that can be displayed in any modern web browser, and will let you
create things like line graphs, bar graphs, labels, heat maps, and other visualizations.

This assignment must be completed in a team of 2. If you wish to work in a team of three,
please seek instructor permission.
