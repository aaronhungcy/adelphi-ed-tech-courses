Description

:   Open education combines practices from Free Software development with (radically) student-centered pedagogy. In open education, free learning resources are developed collaboratively using the global internet, tailored locally to the specific needs of learners, and studied collaboratively. Students in this course consider the underlying principles of open education: why it works, when it fails, how it relates to "traditional" education, and what we want it to look like.
