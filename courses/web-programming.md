% Programming web-based educational media
% Matthew X. Curinga

**Description:** In this course students learn techniques of web programming to develop
interactive, educational media. Using the Python programming language
and web development technologies (HTML5, Javascript, CSS), students gain
practice in the object oriented programming and design of interactive
software. For their final project, students will create their own
educational website.

## Goals and Objectives
This course builds on CSC 602 to move beyond basic programming concepts;
students will gain expertise in building more complex computer programs,
over many iterations. At the end of the course, students will be able to
design educationally sound web-based learning media, solve moderately
complex problems using OOP, collaborate on programming projects, and
identify methods for teaching programming and web development.

Specific teaching and learning goals include:

-   designing web-based interactions and multimedia to support learning\
-   coding effective user interfaces for learning
-   implementing Universal Design goals for accessible web sites
-   identifying effective methods for teaching more advanced programming
    concepts and web design skills

Specific software development goals include:

-   modeling real world problems with software
-   planning iterations of a project
-   testing and debugging
-   Object oriented programming concepts:
-   Abstraction
-   Encapsulation
-   Objects & Classes
-   Composition
-   Inheritance
-   Polymorphism

## Assignments

Students in this class are given 3 open-ended challenges. The challenges
become increasingly complex and are designed to scaffold students into
tackling more complex analysis and programming projects. The challenges
are designed to be solved in pairs. The first two challenges have an
optional "bonus", which is meant to give more advanced teams a
challenge.

1.  **Photo gallery (30%):** students will enter the world of
    Web-based APIs and interactive web programming by rethinking a
    familiar online idiom, the photo gallery. Using the Flickr API, they
    will create their own gallery software. *Bonus*: use the jQuery
    javascript library to add visual effects to your gallery.

2.  **Word Frequency Statistics (30%):** Students will parse texts
    to create a variety of word frequency statistics. The input text can
    be uploaded or submitted via a form. The results are displayed as
    HTML. *Bonus*: create “Wordle” or tag-cloud style visualizations of
    the results and/or pull in source text from other website URLs.

3.  **Final project (40%):** student teams will propose, design, and
    execute their own project. The requirements for the project are that
    it demonstrates effective use of the web for supporting learning, as
    well as the student's understanding of software analysis and design.
    The instructor will work with teams to develop suitable projects. In
    addition to submitting the working code, students will turn in a one
    page paper reflecting on the pedagogy informing their design.
