% Programming web-based educational media
% Matthew X. Curinga

**Description:** In this course students learn techniques of web programming to develop
interactive, educational media. Using the Python programming language
and web development technologies (HTML5, Javascript, CSS), students gain
practice in the object oriented programming and design of interactive
software. For their final project, students will create their own
educational website.

## Goals and Objectives
This course builds on CSC 602 to move beyond basic programming concepts;
students will gain expertise in building more complex computer programs,
over many iterations. At the end of the course, students will be able to
design educationally sound web-based learning media, solve moderately
complex problems using OOP, collaborate on programming projects, and
identify methods for teaching programming and web development.

Specific teaching and learning goals include:

-   designing web-based interactions and multimedia to support learning\
-   coding effective user interfaces for learning
-   implementing Universal Design goals for accessible web sites
-   identifying effective methods for teaching more advanced programming
    concepts and web design skills

Specific software development goals include:

-   modeling real world problems with software
-   planning iterations of a project
-   testing and debugging
-   Object oriented programming concepts:
-   Abstraction
-   Encapsulation
-   Objects & Classes
-   Composition
-   Inheritance
-   Polymorphism

## Class Sessions
### Schedule
_This online course runs according to Adelphi's Cycle 3._
_Classes will be on a Sunday-to-Sunday schedule. Students work at their
own pace through the course materials, but must attend at least 4
synchronous labs (either online or in person) during the class._

## Assignments

Students in this class are given 3 open-ended challenges. The challenges
become increasingly complex and are designed to scaffold students into
tackling more complex analysis and programming projects. The challenges
are designed to be solved in pairs. The first two challenges have an
optional "bonus", which is meant to give more advanced teams a
challenge.

1.  **Single Page Website (30%):** students will build a single-page,
    informational website on a topic of their choice. Their website will
    be composed of HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. It will display their
    fluency with the components of HTML, styling with CSS, and enhancing
    user experience with Javascript. The content of the website is
    entirely up to the student. They are encouraged to create a website
    on something they are already familiar with and interested in. This
    is an individual project.

2.  **Word Frequency Statistics (30%):** Students will parse texts
    to create a variety of word frequency statistics. The input text can
    be uploaded or submitted via a form. The results are displayed as
    HTML. *Bonus*: create “Wordle” or tag-cloud style visualizations of
    the results and/or pull in source text from other website URLs.

3.  **Final project (40%):** student teams will propose, design, and
    execute their own project. The requirements for the project are that
    it demonstrates effective use of the web for supporting learning, as
    well as the student's understanding of software analysis and design.
    The instructor will work with teams to develop suitable projects. In
    addition to submitting the working code, students will turn in a one
    page paper reflecting on the pedagogy informing their design.
