**EDT 603 _Programming web-based educational media_, Spring 2013**

**Description:** In this course students learn techniques of web
programming to develop interactive, educational media. Using the
Python programming language and web development technologies (HTML5,
Javascript, CSS), students gain practice in the object oriented
programming and design of interactive software. For their final
project, students will create their own educational website.

## Course Format

This course is fully online. Each week there will be a series of
topics, for students to pursue at their own pace. Weeks will run on
a Monday-to-Monday schedule. Assignments for the week are due on the
following Monday.

This course runs on the Cycle 3 schedule. It begins on Monday
January 27 and ends on Monday March 18.

Instruction will come from several sources:

* the course text book (Duckett)
* web resources, especially Code Academy
* instructor videos

There will be instructor led labs during office hours every week, both
online via Google Hangout and in-person on the Garden City campus.

Students _must_ attend at least 4 lab sessions. Assignments will be
posted to this wiki and other communications will be sent via the
Google Group Email List --

## Goals and Objectives

This course builds on CSC 602 to move beyond basic programming
concepts; students will gain expertise in building more complex
computer programs, over many iterations. At the end of the course,
students will be able to design educationally sound web-based
learning media, solve moderately complex problems using OOP,
collaborate on programming projects, and identify methods for
teaching programming and web development.

Specific teaching and learning goals include:

-   designing web-based interactions and multimedia to support learning\
-   coding effective user interfaces for learning
-   implementing Universal Design goals for accessible web sites
-   identifying effective methods for teaching more advanced programming
    concepts and web design skills

Specific software development goals include:

-   modeling real world problems with software
-   planning iterations of a project
-   testing and debugging
-   Object oriented programming concepts:
-   Abstraction
-   Encapsulation
-   Objects & Classes
-   Composition
-   Inheritance
-   Polymorphism

## Assignments & Grading

There are two major projects in this course, the _single page
website_ and the _dynamic web application_. Other grades come from
particiaption and improvement.

### Participation (15%)

Students are expected to be active participants in the course,
communicating via email, posting to the wiki, and completing
assignments in a timely manner. The course instructors will base the
participation grade on the quality and timeliness of their
participation in the course.

### Improvement (15%)

The two coding projects will be based on mastery of the skills of
web development. Because students come to the course with different
skill sets, part of their final assessment will be based on their
improvement. In the first week of the course, students will post a
short, narrative self-assessment of their web programming skills:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, (Python or other) Programming, and general
understanding of how the Interent and Web work.

At the end of the semester, each student will email the instructors
with an updated assessment and the grade they think they deserve for
their improvement.
    
### Single Page Website (30%)

Students will build a single-page,
informational website on a topic of their choice. Their website
will be composed of HTML, CSS, and (optionally) Javascript. It
will display their fluency with the components of HTML, styling
with CSS, and enhancing user experience with Javascript. The
content of the website is entirely up to the student. They are
encouraged to create a website on something they are already
familiar with and interested in. This is an individual project.

### Dynamic web application (40%)

Student teams will propose, design, and execute a project. The
project can be completed individually, or in a 2-person team. The
requirements for the project are that it demonstrates the students
understanding of server-side and client-side web development. The
instructor will work with teams to develop suitable projects.
