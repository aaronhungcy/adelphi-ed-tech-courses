**Description:** In this course students learn techniques of web
programming to develop interactive, educational media. Using the
Python programming language and web development technologies (HTML5,
Javascript, CSS), students gain practice in the object oriented
programming and design of interactive software. For their final
project, students will create their own educational website.

**Key words:** computer science, web development, python, interaction
design, django, html, html5, css, javascript, OOP

Goals and Objectives
========================================================================

This course builds on CSC 602 to move beyond basic programming
concepts; students will gain expertise in building more complex
computer programs, over many iterations. At the end of the course,
students will be able to design educationally sound web-based
learning media, solve moderately complex problems using OOP,
collaborate on programming projects, and identify methods for
teaching programming and web development.

Specific teaching and learning goals include:

-   designing web-based interactions and multimedia to support learning
-   coding effective user interfaces for learning
-   implementing Universal Design goals for accessible web sites
-   identifying effective methods for teaching more advanced programming
    concepts and web design skills

Specific software development goals include:

-   modeling real world problems with software
-   planning iterations of a project
-   testing and debugging
-   Object oriented programming concepts:
-   Abstraction
-   Encapsulation
-   Objects & Classes
-   Composition
-   Inheritance
-   Polymorphism

Assignments & Grading
========================================================================

There are two major projects in this course, the _single page
website_ and the _dynamic web application_. Other grades come from
particiaption and improvement.

Improvement (10%)
----------------------------------------

The two coding projects will be based on mastery of the skills of
web development. Because students come to the course with different
skill sets, part of their final assessment will be based on their
improvement. In the first week of the course, students will post a
short, narrative self-assessment of their web programming skills:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, (Python or other) Programming, and general
understanding of how the Interent and Web work.

At the end of the semester, each student will email the instructors
with an updated assessment and the grade they think they deserve for
their improvement.
    
Single Page Website (40%)
----------------------------------------

Students will build a single-page,
informational website on a topic of their choice. Their website
will be composed of HTML, CSS, and (optionally) Javascript. It
will display their fluency with the HTML elements, styling
with CSS, and enhancing user experience with Javascript. The
content of the website is entirely up to the student. They are
encouraged to create a website on something they are already
familiar with and interested in. This is an individual project.

The project will be graded on the following criteria:

1. **Technical design (15 pts):**
    - is html code well formatted and error free?
    - are html elements used appropriately 
      to give semantic structure to the document?
    - are elements combined in ways to make complex layouts?
    - is the document elegant? does it use tags minimally, 
      but in a way that makes it clear for developers to read?
2. **Graphic design (10 pts):**
    - aesthetics
    - usability
    - media (images, video, audio)
    - typography
3. **Information architecture (10 pts)::**
    - logical structure of information
    - organization of internal links on page
4. **Impact (5 pts):**
    - does the site deliver an important message?
    - do the design and content (copy) work together?

Dynamic web application (40%)
----------------------------------------

Student teams will propose, design, and execute a project. The
project can be completed individually, or in a 2-person team. The
requirements for the project are that it demonstrates the students
understanding of server-side and client-side web development. The
instructor will work with teams to develop suitable projects.
