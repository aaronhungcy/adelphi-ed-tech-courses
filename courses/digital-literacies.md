## Description
How do multimedia, texting, chat, status updates, and hypertext change
the way we read and interpret texts? Students study various theories of
literacy and how it changes with the introduction of digital
technologies. Readings will include selections on new media, new
literacy, multiliteracies, multimedia cognition, and visual semantics.

This foundational course provides students a conceptual framework to
critically interpret digital media, and to author powerful and effective
digital documents. Students have the opportunity to practice and develop
these skills, which are central to many aspects of the degree in
[Educational Technology](http://education.adelphi.edu/ed-tech).

## Goals and objectives
Two overarching goals drive this course. First, students should
understand the literacy skills required to critically interpret digital
texts. Second, they should learn how to communicate effectively using
the tools and techniques of digital media. More specifically:

* Students will develop a conception of "digital literacy" as a multifaceted, social process of decoding audio and visual symbols and signals.
* Students will gain a familiarity with a range of research perspectives which engage with digital literacy. 
* Students will refine their understanding of the affordances of a range of media, and these features' implications for literacy.
* Students will confront and assess their own preconceived ideas about technology skills and how learners acquire them.
* Students will be able to create a variety of digital texts to communicate in different genres and for multiple purposes. 
* Students will be able to articulate the cultural and political implications of digital communications, with attention to concerns of power and equity online and in classrooms.

## Class sessions

### New media
In the introductory session, we will talk about the topics of digital
literacies, and begin the discussion of "new media" more generally, as
an important foundation of digital literacy.

Reading due: Manovich, ch 1, start Diamond Age

### Hypertext
In this class we look at "hypertext" as an important and unique concept
in literacy; beginning with precursors and early the World Wide Web (Ted
Nelson, Hypercard, Tim Berners Lee) and then looking at the state of the
web and hypertext today.

Reading due: Manovich, ch 5; Nelson; Dwight; Berners-Lee

### Participatory culture
Digital literacy includes authoring digital texts, not just reading
them. This session looks at work on the idea of participatory culture;
as well as some critics of the need to participate.

Readings due: Jenkins

### New literacies 1
New literacies expands the definition of "literacy" to include different
media and different contexts. These two sessions look at the work of
major scholars in this field, such as Jim Gee, Knobel and Lankshear,
Brian Street, and Kevin Leander.

Readings due: Lankshear ch 1, 2, 5-8

### New literacies 2
This sessions continues the reading and discussion of new literacies.

Readings due: Leu; Street

### Multimedia/multimodal cognition
This session builds on the research of Meyer & Moreno into how people
process and understand multimedia, from a cognition and learning point
of view.

Readings due: Moreno; Manovic ch 2

### Visual culture & digital semantics
In this sessions, students investigate the ways that we understand new
media and digital media. It combines work in "visual culture" (Mirzoeff)
with scholarship in semantics and digital literacy (e.g. Kress, van
Leeuwen).

Readings due: Mirzoeff ch 1, 3

### Diamond Age, the illustrated primary and digital literacy
The class will discuss Neil Stephenson's novel, Diamond Age, in terms of
the various literacies supported by the hypothetical, “Young Lady's
Illustrated Primer.”

Readings due: finish Diamond Age

### Digital community
Much of the draw of the internet — and skills required for participation
— revolve around online communities. This session looks at what it means
to have a virtual or online community, and how these communities develop
their own literacy codes and practices.

Readings due: Agre

### Identity online
In this session, students look at online identity: issues of race,
gender, and class as well as ideas of anonymity.

Readings due: Mirzoeff ch 6, 8

### Going mobile
Most people in the world access the internet through mobile devices.
This session looks at the unique ways that mobile computing — especially
differences in space and time — affects literacy practices.

Readings due: Castells

### Going virtual
Students engage with ideas of virtuality, considering how we read
"immersive" virtual environments such as virtual reality and virtual
worlds, as well as the literature on "embodied cognition" which looks at
the interface between the digital and the physical world.

Readings due: Kahn & Keller

### Authority and legitimation of digital texts
With digital texts, we have moved from a scarcity of information to and
over-abundance of information. This session looks at the authority of
online materials in terms of both mass media/journalism as well as for
scholarship and research.

Readings due: Barthes

### Computational literacy
Computational algorithms exist behind the scenes of digital media.
Understanding the implications of computation is requisite for
understanding digital works.

Readings due: Reimann; Manovich ch 5; Steinkuehler

### Reading human-computer interfaces
This session draws on work from the fields of human-computer interface
(HCI) design, affordance theory, and interaction design to help students
develop a critical understanding of software and other computer
interfaces.

Readings due: Manovich ch 2; Norman ch 1

## Assignments
Students will complete a variety of in-class and homework assignments
that ask them to reflect on the theories of digital literacy and to
effectively use digital tools to create new media texts. The following
assignments will allow the instructor to evaluate their progress.

**Slideshow presentation: my tech biography.** In this assignments students
will reflect on their history of interacting with and learning digital
technologies. They will be responsible for creating a multimedia
slideshow on the topic. Both the contents of the slideshow and the
skills exhibited by the students will allow the instructor to gauge
their facility with producing digital media. (15%)

**Semantic map: digital literacies landscape.** Students will create a
semantic map which shows the varied skills and contexts required to be
considered _fully literate_ in the networked society. They will have to
identify major and minor areas of literacy and indicate how they are
related to each other. This assignment will allow the instructor to
evaluate how well the students can synthesize the course readings
explaining the digital literacy landscape. (15%)

**Diamond Age reaction paper.** After completing Diamond Age students will
write a short (~1500 word) paper reacting to the educational technology
in the novel. They will be asked to evaluate the “Illustrated Primer” in
terms of the theories of literacy and learning covered in class, as well
as by the novel's stated purpose to create an instrument to teach
“subversion.” The paper will offer the instructor insight into the
students ability to express the concepts of digital literacy in the
format of academic writing, as well as to apply their learning to a
(hypothetical) educational technology. (20%)

**Semantic and visual software review screen cast.** Each student will
create a “screen cast”— a narrated video —of an educational software
title or website. They will reflect on and evaluate the software from a
visual culture and new media semantics position. This assignment will
allow evaluation of their understanding of the field of visual culture
and new media semantics, as well as their ability to use the set of
digital tools to create a screen cast. (20%)

**Digital literacies “Ted Talk”.** Working in teams of 3 or 4, students will
create a multimedia presentation in the style of a “Ted Talk.” This
presentation will require each group to research a topic of the course
in greater detail (in consultation with the instructor), and to create
presentations that incorporates a variety of digital production tools.
The assignment is designed to assess the students' ability to use
digital tools to communicate effectively, and to use their own resources
to further their knowledge of digital literacies. (30%)
