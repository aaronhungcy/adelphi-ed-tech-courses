## Description
How do multimedia, texting, chat, status updates, and hypertext change
the way we read and interpret texts? Students study various theories of
literacy and how it changes with the introduction of digital
technologies. Readings will include selections on new media, new
literacy, multiliteracies, multimedia cognition, and visual semantics.

This foundational course provides students a conceptual framework to
critically interpret digital media, and to author powerful and effective
digital documents. Students have the opportunity to practice and develop
these skills, which are central to many aspects of the degree in
[Educational Technology](http://education.adelphi.edu/ed-tech).

## Goals and objectives
Two overarching goals drive this course. First, students should
understand the literacy skills required to critically interpret digital
texts. Second, they should learn how to communicate effectively using
the tools and techniques of digital media. More specifically:

* Students will develop a conception of "digital literacy" as a multifaceted, social process of
decoding audio and visual symbols and signals.
* Students will gain a familiarity with a range of research perspectives which engage with digital
literacy. 
* Students will refine their understanding of the affordances of a range of media, and these
features' implications for literacy.
* Students will confront and assess their own preconceived ideas about literacy and technology
skills and how
learners acquire them.
* Students will be able to create a variety of digital texts to communicate in different genres and
for multiple purposes. 
* Students will be able to articulate the cultural and political implications of communication, with
attention to concerns of
power and equity online and in classrooms.

## Class sessions

### Week 1, August 30: Changes in language, changes in literacy
What is literacy? What does it mean to be "literate"? Through exploring the concrete examples of
medieval documents and missionary education, this session establishes how the changing nature
of documents, and their relationship to powerful social institutions, can change what skills may be
required for a person to be considered "literate."

*  Readings due: 
1.  Clanchy, 1993, ch 9, pp 294-327
2.  Street, social literacies ch 2, pp 28-45

*  Assignment 1 (tech biography) due


### Week 2, September 6: Literacy and society
Is there only one kind of literacy? What kinds of literacy are "better" than others, and why? This
class explores how some "literate" skills may be valued differently by various social institutions,
and how different kinds of literacy may be present alongside each other in and outside of
classrooms.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Gee, situated language and learning ch 1-4, pp 1-56
2.  Lankshear and Knobel, ch 2, pp 32-51


### Week 3, September 13: New literacies 
New literacies expands the definition of "literacy" to include different
media and different contexts. These two sessions look at the work of
major scholars in this field, such as Jim Gee, Knobel and Lankshear,
and Kevin Leander.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Leu et al
2.  Lankshear and Knobel 2011 ch 1, 3, pp 3-32, 51-93
3.  Street 2003 p 77-91


### Week 4, September 20: Visual culture & digital semantics
In this sessions, students investigate the ways that we understand new
media and digital media. The session combines work in "visual culture" (Mirzoeff) with analysis of
the form of comics (McCloud).

*  Readings due: 
1.  Mirzoeff ch 1, p 35-62
2.  Wardrip-Fruin, ch 50 p 711-737 <!-- Scott McCloud -->


### Week 5, October 4: Reading like a machine
While computers seem to get "smarter" every year, able to predict what we want before we even know
we want it, beneath the surface layer of interaction they may still require us to think they way
they do
to communicate. This class explores some of the ways in which computers "read" differently from
people, with limitations and demands which are helpful to understand in navigating digital texts.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Berners-Lee (about 7 pp)
2.  Brunton, ch 2 section 4 on Robot Readability (about 20 pp)
3.  Suchman in Wardrip-Fruin, ch 41, pp 599-609

<!-- Was going to use Suchman, ch 9, pp 125-175, which is the chapter in which xerox
machines actually appear, but it's rough sledding and the other one actually appears in
Wardrip-Fruin. Winograd and Flores is similar tho. Maybe have an intelligent systems week? -->


### Week 6, October 11: Design and human-computer interfaces
This session draws on work from the fields of human-computer interface
(HCI) design, affordance theory, computer security, and interaction design to help students
develop a critical understanding of software and other computer
interfaces.

1.  Norman ch 1, pp 1-33 
2.  Conti, 9 pp
3.  Winograd and Flores 1986 ch 37 in Wardrip-Fruin, pp 551-562 <!-- design and intelligent systems -->


### Week 7, October 18: Privacy, security, and the law
What do students need to be able to read about digital texts in order to maintain their security and
privacy online? As educators, what is our role in working with them on privacy -- are we guides,
should we remain hands-off, or do they already know more than we do? In class, we will view "Privacy
is Dead," a talk given by private investigator Steven Rambam at the Hackers On Planet Earth (HOPE)
Conference.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Lessig, Code, ch 1-4 (in original)
2.  boyd et al, 22 pp


### Week 8, October 25: Media literacy
Media literacy has been a field in which the commercial influence of advertising is often taken as
shaping texts, often for the worse. Advertising still shapes the content we see online. What do we need to know about the influences of advertising to be "literate"? This session presents the basic questions
broached by media literacy scholars, and looks into how they may be extended to digital literacy.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Hobbs, seven great debates
2.  some other good establishing document from that field


### Week 9, November 1: Information literacy
Library science and information literacy have attempted to determine how people successfully search
for information, beginning with library materials before digitization and continuing to understand
how people look for information online today. "Information literacy" has also been referred to in
national policy statements outlining what students need to know in a digital world. In this session,
we will explore how "information literacy" fits in to other
understandings of literacy.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Tuominen et al 2005; 14 pp. 
2.  Savolainen 2007, 23 pp.


### Week 10, November 8: Source literacy
Every text, digital or otherwise, is constructed by some sort of "author." Media literacy,
information literacy, and library studies agree that it is important to understand a text's source
in order to evaluate the quality of its contents. How far can this go? Most of us know we should
evaluate the quality of information on Wikipedia, but how often can we investigate the sources of
what we read? Do we always have to evaluate the quality of news reporting? Of textbooks? What are the specific challenges to our sourcing abilities presented by
digital materials? This session explores how different literacy traditions have approached
sourcing.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Laurie Henry 2006 12 pp <!-- (SEARCH, not all tree octopus) -->
2.  Hargittai 2008 Links of Influence 16 pp 
3.  Feynman, pp 288-302

    * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view


### Week 11, November 15: Audience awareness (shades into identity and also media literacy)
Texts are constructed by authors, but also constructed for audiences. Digital technologies have
dramatically changed how audiences can be reached. As readers, how do we think of ourselves as an
audience; as writers, how do we communicate to audiences in a dramatically changed world? This
session explores these questions.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Lankshear and Knobel 2011 ch 6 (social networking)
2.  Shirky ch 3,4? p 55-108

### Week 13, December 6: Participatory culture and copyright (latter might be its own week actually?)
Digital literacy includes creating digital texts, not just reading
them. This session looks at work on the idea of participatory culture;
as well as some critics of the need to participate.

### Week 15, December 20: Presentations
Students will present their final projects 


## Assignments
Students will complete a variety of in-class and homework assignments
that ask them to reflect on the theories of digital literacy and to
effectively use digital tools to create new media texts. The following
assignments will allow the instructor to evaluate their progress.

**Slideshow presentation: my tech biography.** In this assignments students
will reflect on their history of interacting with and learning digital
technologies. They will be responsible for creating a multimedia
slideshow on the topic. Both the contents of the slideshow and the
skills exhibited by the students will allow the instructor to gauge
their facility with producing digital media. (15%)

**Semantic map: digital literacies landscape.** Students will create a
semantic map which shows the varied skills and contexts required to be
considered _fully literate_ in the networked society. They will have to
identify major and minor areas of literacy and indicate how they are
related to each other. This assignment will allow the instructor to
evaluate how well the students can synthesize the course readings
explaining the digital literacy landscape. (15%)

**Semantic and visual software review screen cast.** Each student will
create a “screen cast”— a narrated video —of an educational software
title or website produced using a tool such as Camtasia, IShowU, or Jing. They will reflect on the software in light of the units on visual culture, design/HCI,
privacy/security, computational literacy, source literacy, and identity. The screencast should include evaluations of what
their own students or other users would need to know to navigate the site/software being reviewed.
This assignment will allow evaluation of their understanding of these lessons, as well as their ability to use the set of
digital tools to create a screen cast. (20%)

**Digital literacies “Ted Talk”.** Working in teams of 3 or 4, students will
create a multimedia presentation in the style of a “Ted Talk.” This
presentation will require each group to research a topic of the course
in greater detail (in consultation with the instructor), and to create
presentations that incorporates a variety of digital production tools.
The assignment is designed to assess the students' ability to use
digital tools to communicate effectively, and to use their own resources
to further their knowledge of digital literacies. (30%)
