**Key words:** digital literacies, multileracies, new literacy, semantics, new media, communication
theory, youth media

## Description
How do multimedia, texting, chat, status updates, and hypertext change
the way we read and interpret texts? Students study various theories of
literacy and how it changes with the introduction of digital
technologies. Readings will include selections on new media, new
literacy, multiliteracies, multimedia cognition, and visual semantics.

This foundational course provides students a conceptual framework to
critically interpret digital media, and to author powerful and effective
digital documents. Students have the opportunity to practice and develop
these skills, which are central to many aspects of the degree in
[Educational Technology](http://education.adelphi.edu/ed-tech).

## Goals and objectives
Two overarching goals drive this course. First, students should
understand the literacy skills required to critically interpret digital
texts. Second, they should learn how to communicate effectively using
the tools and techniques of digital media. More specifically:

* Students will develop a conception of "digital literacy" as a multifaceted, social process of
decoding audio and visual symbols and signals.
* Students will gain a familiarity with a range of research perspectives which engage with digital
literacy. 
* Students will refine their understanding of the affordances of a range of media, and these
features' implications for literacy.
* Students will confront and assess their own preconceived ideas about literacy and technology
skills and how
learners acquire them.
* Students will be able to create a variety of digital texts to communicate in different genres and
for multiple purposes. 
* Students will be able to articulate the cultural and political implications of communication, with
attention to concerns of
power and equity online and in classrooms.

## Class sessions

### Week 1, August 30: Changes in language, changes in literacy
What is literacy? What does it mean to be "literate"? Through exploring the concrete examples of
medieval documents and missionary education, this session establishes how the changing nature
of documents, and their relationship to powerful social institutions, can change what skills may be
required for a person to be considered "literate."

*  Readings due: 
1.  Clanchy, 1993, ch 9, pp 294-327
2.  Street, social literacies ch 2, pp 28-45

*  Assignment 1 (tech biography) due


### Week 2, September 6: Literacy and society
Is there only one kind of literacy? What kinds of literacy are "better" than others, and why? This
class explores how some "literate" skills may be valued differently by various social institutions,
and how different kinds of literacy may be present alongside each other in and outside of
classrooms.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Gee, situated language and learning ch 1-4, pp 1-56
2.  Lankshear and Knobel, ch 2, pp 32-51


### Week 3, September 13: New literacies 
New literacies expands the definition of "literacy" to include different
media and different contexts. These two sessions look at the work of
major scholars in this field, such as Jim Gee, Knobel and Lankshear,
and Kevin Leander.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Leu et al
2.  Lankshear and Knobel 2011 ch 1, 3, pp 3-32, 51-93
3.  Street 2003 p 77-91


### Week 4, September 20: Visual culture & digital semantics
In this sessions, students investigate the ways that we understand new
media and digital media. The session combines work in "visual culture" (Mirzoeff) with analysis of
the form of comics (McCloud).

*  Readings due: 
1.  Mirzoeff ch 1, p 35-62
2.  Wardrip-Fruin, ch 50 p 711-737 <!-- Scott McCloud -->


### Week 5, October 4: Reading like a machine
While computers seem to get "smarter" every year, able to predict what we want before we even know
we want it, beneath the surface layer of interaction they may still require us to think they way
they do
to communicate. This class explores some of the ways in which computers "read" differently from
people, with limitations and demands which are helpful to understand in navigating digital texts.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Berners-Lee (about 7 pp)
2.  Brunton, ch 2 section 4 on Robot Readability (about 20 pp)
3.  Suchman in Wardrip-Fruin, ch 41, pp 599-609

<!-- Was going to use Suchman, ch 9, pp 125-175, which is the chapter in which xerox
machines actually appear, but it's rough sledding and the other one actually appears in
Wardrip-Fruin. Winograd and Flores is similar tho. Maybe have an intelligent systems week? -->


### Week 6, October 11: Design and human-computer interfaces
This session draws on work from the fields of human-computer interface
(HCI) design, affordance theory, computer security, and interaction design to help students
develop a critical understanding of software and other computer
interfaces.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Norman ch 1, pp 1-33 
2.  Conti, 9 pp
3.  Winograd and Flores 1986 ch 37 in Wardrip-Fruin, pp 551-562 <!-- design and intelligent systems -->


### Week 7, October 18: Privacy, security, and the law
What do students need to be able to read about digital texts in order to maintain their security and
privacy online? As educators, what is our role in working with them on privacy -- are we guides,
should we remain hands-off, or do they already know more than we do? In class, we will view "Privacy
is Dead," a talk given by private investigator Steven Rambam at the Hackers On Planet Earth (HOPE)
Conference.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Lessig, Code, ch 1-4 (in original)
2.  boyd et al, 22 pp


### Week 8, October 25: Media literacy
Media literacy has been a field in which the commercial influence of advertising is often taken as
shaping texts, often for the worse. Advertising still shapes the content we see online. What do we need to know about the influences of advertising to be "literate"? This session presents the basic questions
broached by media literacy scholars, and looks into how they may be extended to digital literacy.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Hobbs, seven great debates
2.  some other good establishing document from that field


### Week 9, November 1: Information literacy
Library science and information literacy have attempted to determine how people successfully search
for information, beginning with library materials before digitization and continuing to understand
how people look for information online today. "Information literacy" has also been referred to in
national policy statements outlining what students need to know in a digital world. In this session,
we will explore how "information literacy" fits in to other
understandings of literacy.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Tuominen et al 2005; 14 pp. 
2.  Savolainen 2007, 23 pp.


### Week 10, November 8: Source literacy
Every text, digital or otherwise, is constructed by some sort of "author." Media literacy,
information literacy, and library studies agree that it is important to understand a text's source
in order to evaluate the quality of its contents. How far can this go? Most of us know we should
evaluate the quality of information on Wikipedia, but how often can we investigate the sources of
what we read? Do we always have to evaluate the quality of news reporting? Of textbooks? What are the specific challenges to our sourcing abilities presented by
digital materials? This session explores how different literacy traditions have approached
sourcing.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Laurie Henry 2006 12 pp <!-- (SEARCH, not all tree octopus) -->
2.  Hargittai 2008 Links of Influence 16 pp 
3.  Feynman, pp 288-302
4.  If Matt has not covered this elsewhere in the curriculum: 
    * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability
    * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources
    * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research
    * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view


### Week 11, November 15: Audience awareness (shades into identity and also media literacy)
Texts are constructed by authors, but also constructed for audiences. Digital technologies have
dramatically changed how audiences can be reached. As readers, how do we think of ourselves as an
audience; as writers, how do we communicate to audiences in a dramatically changed world? This
session explores these questions.

*  Readings due: 
1.  Lankshear and Knobel 2011 ch 6 (social networking)
2.  Shirky ch 3,4? p 55-108

*  Assignment 3 (screencast) due


### Week 13, December 6: Participatory culture and copyright (latter might be its own week actually?)
Digital literacy includes creating digital texts, not just reading
them. This session looks at work on the idea of participatory culture;
as well as some critics of the need to participate.

## Assignments

### Digital portfolio
You will create a digital portfolio that highlights your understanding and proficiency with various digital literacies. You will be adding items to this portfolio throughout the term. You _must_ show a breadth of expertise, with basic proficiency in each area of digital literacy. Additionally, you _must_ demonstrate a depth of expertise in at least one of the areas below. You will turn in your portfolio for final evaluation at the end of the course, along with a narrative introduction that guides evaluators through it.

HTML/Hypertext

:   HTML is the basic building block of the Web and the most pervasive form of hypertext in use today. While most HTML is generated dynamically by web-based programming languages and/or GUI editors, understanding how to _hand code_ html is an important piece of digital literacy as a both a consumer and producer of digital texts. To satisfy the **basic** HTML requirement in your portfolio, you will write your own resume and biography/introduction in HTML. **Advanced** HTML will include CSS stylesheets and multimedia. It should use principles of Universal Design for the Web, best practices for web usability and design, display well for large, media, small screens, and print, be error free, and, generally look and feel great. _What_ you produce in HTML is up to you, as long as it is your own work, or work where you are a principal contributor.

Digital Images

:   We live in a visual culture, and the ability to communicate using images is essential. The verb, "to photoshop" something has become common place in our society. Everyone's portfolio must contain a **collage** where they exhibit their skills in digital image editing: cropping, scaling, selecting, composting, using layers, combining text and images. In addition to these _technical_ requirements, your collage must also strive for expressive content, common in our study of new media: playfulness, non-linearity and multiplicity, irony/paradox, etc.

Digital Video and Audio

:   [72 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute](http://www.youtube.com/t/press_statistics/). Online video for teaching and learning have exploded, popularized by sites like [TED](http://ted.com) and [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/). Your portfolio must include a 60-90s video, where you teach _something_. The video can be made with footage that you shoot (with your phone, tablet, flipcam), find online and remix, create from still images, or "screencast" on your computer. At the very least, the video must be edited. Upload your video to YouTube and embed it in your portfolio.

Collaborative Production

:   Digital literacy is networked literacy. Software, encyclopedias, novels, video games, films, politics, and any number of creative works are now produced collaboratively. To demonstrate your **basic** understanding of collaborative production, you will create an account on Wikipedia (if you don't have one) and contribute **10 edits** which meet the standards and practices established by the Wikipedia community. These should be minor edits: fixing spelling and grammatical errors, adding reliable sources for unsourced articles, participating in the discussion on talk pages, etc. Your portfolio should include a page which offers a brief reflection on your editing experience, examples of your contributions (before/after), and links to the pages you changed.

Video Game Literacy

:   Video games are more popular than movies, and players cut across ethnic, gender, class, and other boundaries. Using the Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics framwork, post a 1-page (300-400 word) analysis of a video game of your choice.

Privacy & Security

:    Your portfolio must include a **personal security audit**. Your audit will examine your digital and social practices to look for weaknesses. You must consider:
    
    1. what **digital data** is most precious to you? do you have back-ups? how are they managed? can you restore them? if you keep your data "in the cloud", can you retrieve it all at once? can you keep your own backup? _do you_? are you locked into a certain service (e.g. flickr, facebook, gmail)? are you locked into a proprietary format that would prevent you from switching? are their social/network pressures that influence you?
    2. **financial security.** How do you choose passwords? How strong are they? Do you share them? Do you use them across multiple sites? What would happen if one of your passwords an email were stolen from a site you belong to? Can you list all of the sites/services that have financial information (e.g. CC, bank account, SSN)? In order, which of these do you think are the most secure?
    3. **personal digital security.** Do you run a firewall on your desktop or laptop computer? Is there a password on your phone or tablet? If I stole your phone, what would I find? Do you encrypt any files on your computer? If I logged into your computer (or networked account) as you, what damage could I do? What steps do you take to minimize this damage?
    4. **social security.** If I Google your name, what do I see? Would you want your mom to see it? Your (potential) boss? Do the top hits give the image you want to project? What if I look on Bing, Yahoo, or Duck Duck Go?\
    What about Facebook or that old MySpace account? How much information is public, or shared with your "networks" (i.e. everyone on Facebook)? What is the worst case if your FB account were hacked? What if you have a falling out with a close friend or lover? If you were hoping for a job with the Obama or Romney presedition campaigns and they asked to see your personal FB account, would you still get the job? Do you care?

Data literacy

:   The networked society is characterized by the problem of overabundance rather than scarcity of information. This means you must be able to to gather, analyze, and communicate large amounts of data. While not all of this information is quantitative, this portfolio item focuses on quantitative analysis. You will demonstrate your **basic data literacy** by:

    1. Finding and downloading an interesting (and sufficiently large) data set.
    2. Analyzing it using spreadsheet software.
    3. Discovering something interesting in the data.
    4. Creating a multimedia (text and image) representation of your interesting finding (like a series of graphs or an infographic).
    
    Some places to look for data sets:
    
    * [Bureau of labor statistics](http://www.bls.gov/)
    * [U.S. Census Data Tools](http://www.census.gov/main/www/access.html)
    * [NYC Schools Accountability Data](http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/default.htm)
    * [National Center for Education Statistics](http://nces.ed.gov/)

    * [Datamob "meta" collector of datasets](http://datamob.org/datasets)

### Workshop
Students in this course come in with a wide range of skills and competencies. As part of your participation in this course, you need to schedule and lead a workshop for your peers on a practical area of "digital literacy." You don't need to be an expert in the area -- rather, you should take a little bit of extra time to become proficient before leading the workshop. You can run your workshop alone, or with a partner. If you work with a partner, depending on the number of students, you may need to present twice. In addition to facilitating a workshop, everyone must **participate in at least two** workshops. Workshops will be scheduled at the convenience of the facilitators, either on the Adelphi campus or online.

Here is the tenative schedule of workshops. You will have the opportunity to sign up for one, and to discuss the content covered with the instructor. If you have an idea for another workshop, please suggest it.

2. HTML5 basics
3. Basic image editing with GIMP
4. Shooting digital video (and audio)
5. Basic digital video editing with iMovie and YouTube
6. Podcasting (with Audacity and iTunes)
7. Screencasting (with Jira and/or RecordMyDesktop)
8. Who's afraid of a spreadsheet? excel and spreadsheet basics
9. Functions, graphs, and (more) advanced spreadsheets
