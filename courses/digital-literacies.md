**Key words:** digital literacies, multileracies, new literacy, semantics, new media, communication
theory, youth media, media studies, software studies

Description
====================
How do multimedia, texting, chat, status updates, and hypertext change the way we read and interpret texts? Students study various theories of literacy and how it changes with the introduction of digital technologies. Readings will include selections on new media, new literacy, multiliteracies, multimedia cognition, and visual semantics.

This foundational course provides students a conceptual framework to critically interpret digital media, and to author powerful and effective digital documents. Students have the opportunity to practice and develop these skills, which are central to many aspects of the degree in Educational Technology.

Goals & objectives
====================

Two overarching goals drive this course. First, students should
understand the literacy skills required to critically interpret digital
texts. Second, they should learn how to communicate effectively using
the tools and techniques of digital media. More specifically:

* Students will develop a conception of "digital literacy" as a multifaceted, social process of
  decoding audio and visual symbols and signals.
* Students will gain a familiarity with a range of research perspectives which engage with digital
  literacy. 
* Students will refine their understanding of the affordances of a range of media, and these
  features' implications for literacy.
* Students will confront and assess their own preconceived ideas about literacy and technology
  skills and how learners acquire them.
* Students will be able to create a variety of digital texts to communicate in different genres and
  for multiple purposes. 
* Students will be able to articulate the cultural and political implications of communication, with
  attention to concerns of power and equity online and in classrooms.

Assignments
------------

Digital portfolio
------------------------------
You will create a digital portfolio that highlights your understanding and proficiency with various digital literacies. You will be adding items to this portfolio throughout the term. You _must_ show a breadth of expertise, with basic proficiency in each area of digital literacy. Additionally, you _must_ demonstrate a depth of expertise in at least one of the areas below. You will turn in your portfolio for a midpoint check at the end of the first week, and for final evaluation at the end of the course, along with a narrative introduction that guides evaluators through it.

You will host your digital portfolio on your Adelphi ``panther`` account.


HTML/Hypertext

:   HTML is the basic building block of the Web and the most pervasive form of hypertext in use today. While most HTML is generated dynamically by web-based programming languages and/or GUI editors, understanding how to _hand code_ html is an important piece of digital literacy for both consumers and producers of digital texts. To satisfy the **basic** HTML requirement in your portfolio, you will create a basic HTML porfolio that contains a cover letter, your resume/CV, and links to all of the othe components of the porfolio.  **Advanced** HTML will include CSS stylesheets, multimedia, and/or Javascript. Adbanced html portfolios use principles of Universal Design for the Web, best practices for web usability and design, display well for large, media, small screens, and print, be error free, and, generally look and feel great.

Digital Images

:   We live in a visual culture, and the ability to communicate using images is essential. The verb, "to photoshop" something has become common place in our society. Everyone's portfolio must contain a **collage** where they exhibit their skills in digital image editing: cropping, scaling, selecting, composting, using layers, combining text and images. In addition to these _technical_ requirements, your collage must also strive for expressive content, common in our study of new media: playfulness, non-linearity and multiplicity, irony/paradox, etc.

Digital Video and Audio

:   [100 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute](http://www.youtube.com/t/press_statistics/). Online video for teaching and learning have exploded, popularized by sites like [TED](http://ted.com) and [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/) and video lectures in MOOCs. Your portfolio must include a 60-90 second video, where you teach _something_. The video can be made with footage that you shoot (with your phone, tablet, flipcam), find online and remix, create from still images, or "screencast" on your computer. At the very least, the video must be edited. Upload your video to YouTube and embed it in your portfolio.

Collaborative Production

:   Digital literacy is networked literacy. Software, encyclopedias, novels, video games, films, politics, and any number of creative works are now produced collaboratively. To demonstrate your **basic** understanding of collaborative production, you will create an account on Wikipedia (if you don't have one) and contribute **10 edits** which meet the standards and practices established by the Wikipedia community. These should be minor edits: fixing spelling and grammatical errors, adding reliable sources for unsourced articles, participating in the discussion on talk pages, etc. Your portfolio should include a page which offers a brief reflection on your editing experience, examples of your contributions (before/after), and links to the pages you changed.

Privacy & Security

:    Your portfolio must include a **personal security audit**. Your audit will examine your digital and social practices to look for weaknesses. You must consider:
    
    1. what **digital data** is most precious to you? do you have back-ups? how are they managed? can you restore them? if you keep your data "in the cloud", can you retrieve it all at once? can you keep your own backup? _do you_? are you locked into a certain service (e.g. flickr, facebook, gmail)? are you locked into a proprietary format that would prevent you from switching? are their social/network pressures that influence you?
    2. **financial security.** How do you choose passwords? How strong are they? Do you share them? Do you use them across multiple sites? What would happen if one of your passwords an email were stolen from a site you belong to? Can you list all of the sites/services that have financial information (e.g. CC, bank account, SSN)? In order, which of these do you think are the most secure?
    3. **personal digital security.** Do you run a firewall on your desktop or laptop computer? Is there a password on your phone or tablet? If I stole your phone, what would I find? Do you encrypt any files on your computer? If I logged into your computer (or networked account) as you, what damage could I do? What steps do you take to minimize this damage?
    4. **social security.** If I Google your name, what do I see? Would you want your mom to see it? Your (potential) boss? Do the top hits give the image you want to project? What if I look on Bing, Yahoo, or Duck Duck Go?\
    What about Facebook or that old MySpace account? How much information is public, or shared with your "networks" (i.e. everyone on Facebook)? What is the worst case if your FB account were hacked? What if you have a falling out with a close friend or lover? If you were hoping for a job with the Obama or Romney presedition campaigns and they asked to see your personal FB account, would you still get the job? Do you care?

Data literacy

:   The networked society is characterized by the problem of overabundance rather than scarcity of information. This means you must be able to to gather, analyze, and communicate large amounts of data. While not all of this information is quantitative, this portfolio item focuses on quantitative analysis. You will demonstrate your **basic data literacy** by:

    1. Finding and downloading an interesting (and sufficiently large) data set.
    2. Analyzing it using spreadsheet software.
    3. Discovering something interesting in the data.
    4. Creating a multimedia (text and image) representation of your interesting finding (like a series of graphs or an infographic).
    
    Some places to look for data sets:
    
    * [Bureau of labor statistics](http://www.bls.gov/)
    * [U.S. Census Data Tools](http://www.census.gov/main/www/access.html)
    * [NYC Schools Accountability Data](http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/default.htm)
    * [National Center for Education Statistics](http://nces.ed.gov/)
    * [Wikipedia Data](http://dumps.wikimedia.org/index.html) for the more ambitious
    * [Datamob "meta" collector of datasets](http://datamob.org/datasets)

Participation
------------------------------
