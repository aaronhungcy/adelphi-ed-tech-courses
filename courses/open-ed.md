Description

:   Open education combines practices from Free Software development with (radically) student-centered pedagogy. In open education, free learning resources are developed collaboratively using the global internet, tailored locally to the specific needs of learners, and studied collaboratively. Students in this course consider the underlying principles of open education: why it works, when it fails, how it relates to "traditional" education, and what we want it to look like.

> We need to place our action in the specific context of
> domination and liberation where we live: the network society,
> built around the communication networks of the Internet.<br />
> — Manuel Castells, _Internet Galaxy_

> Now instead the common is the
> locus of freedom and innovation—free access, free use, free expression,
> free interaction—that stands against private control, that is, the
> control exerted by private property, its legal structures, and
> its market forces. Freedom in this context can only be freedom of the common.<br />
> — Michael Hardt & Antonio Negri, _Commonwealth_

> Inevitably, this hidden curriculum of schooling adds prejudice and
> guilt to the discrimination which a society practices against some
> of its members and compounds the privilege of others with a new
> title to condescend to the majority. Just as inevitably, this hidden
> curriculum serves as a ritual of initiation into a growth-oriented
> consumer society for rich and poor alike.<br />
> — Ivan Illich, _Deschooling Society_

## Tools
_Here are some of the digital tools that we will be using to facilitate this course, especially the online portions._

* Adobe Connect: we will use this for synchronous online meetings (i.e. video conferencing, chat, screen sharing). You will need to install the Adobe Connect plug-in. There are also iOS and Android "Connect" apps.\
The URL for our Connect room is:\
<http://adelphi.adobeconnect.com/open-ed>
* [Skype](http://skype.com) is a well tested video chat service. There are clients for Win, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS, etc. The free version limits the number of people to group chats.
* [Google+](http://plus.google.com) has a Hangout feature that has a robust multi-person video chat, which also supports screen sharing, document editing, and other advanced features. You cannot log in with your Adelphi account, you need a plane-jane gmail/google account to access the servie _and_ you need to set up your profile on G+, google's social networking site, even if you just want the hangouts.

* **Synchronous** classes meet on Wed. at 4:30. Students are _encouraged_ to attend in person, at Adelphi's Garden City Campus, in Harvey 104. If you cannot attend in person, you _must_ join us for a video conference.
* **Asynchronous/online** weeks have no set meeting time. They will be carried out by posting writing, video, or other media to the course website. You should consult with your _study group_ every week. During asynchronous weeks, you **must check the course website at least once a day.** Online weeks run from Wednesday to the next Wednesday. A typical online week looks like this:
    - Wed-Sat: do the readings
    - Sun or Mon: post your response online (300-500 words), due by end of day on Monday
    - Mon-Wed: post at least two comments; respond to comments on your post.

### Participation
This will be a reading-heavy course. Whether meeting in-person, over video conference, or asynchronously online, you are expected to be prepared each week. In a typical week, there will be 40-80 pages of reading. Sometimes there will be videos to watch as well. Let's call all of these _texts_.

When you read a text for this course, you should have two things in mind: (1) what is the text arguing? (2) to what extent do you agree with these arguments? You should be in touch with your study group to discuss texts before full group discussions.

Your grade in this area will be a combination of self-, instructor-, and peer-evaluations.

### Personal Learning Plan
You will create a plan for what you want to learn in this course, how it connects to your broader learning goals, and how you hope to accomplish these goals and your plan. Your plan should be a narrative, of approximately 500 words. It may include diagrams, lists, timelines, web links, and other necessary elements. Create it as an Adelphi Google Doc, and post the link to your document on Moodle.

It must include some reflection on:

1. Your **overall goals** (in school, as a person, in life, etc.)
2. **Specific goals** for this course. A good way to formulate goals are to think about **research questions** and **capacities** that you want to explore. For example: "I would like to understand the role of a traditional university in the world of free, online courses" or "I want to learn how to contribute a patch to a Free Software project."
3. **Practices** where and howyou learn best (studying same time every day, setting goals, working in groups, working in library, reading on train, etc.) What's your plan for this semester?
4. **Distractors** and disruptors that make it more difficult to learn/study (work, sports, friends, siblings, Facebook, etc.)
5. **Measures:** how will you know you met your goals, when will/should you be satisfied? (you might measure this by what you produce, like a paper, what you know, or connections you make)
6. **Peers:** who is interested in learning similar things? how did/do you meet them? how do you keep in touch? what do you offer to your peers? how is knowledge shared? what technology do you use?
7. **Mentors:** who do you turn to for help when you are learning things? What types of things do they help you with? Do you need to reach out to more mentors?
8. Your **study group**: a group of 3-5 other students in class who you can contact when you have questions and will meet with (online or in person) to discuss readings, edit your work, etc.

Your initial personal learning plan is due on the second class meeting. You will revise it and turn in a revised draft at the end of the semester.

### Session leader
Everyone in the class will be responsible for leading a class session, either alone or working with a partner (depending on class size). When you sign up to lead a session, you will either be leading an in-person seminar or an online discussion. In either case, you should take extra time to understand the readings for the session you are leading, take notes on the readings, and formulate questions.

In-class seminar leaders may want to open class with a few comments about the texts. How you choose to lead your session is up to you. Here are some techniques that I use (you can mix and match):

* begin with (~15 minutes) of initial free writing/journaling related to the texts, some participants read their entries
* formulate open questions that address a large issue in the text, frame the questions with specific quotations from the works we're studying
* distribute questions to small groups or pairs, and have them work independently on discussion the works. visit the groups while they are discussing the text and join their discussion. share with full group after certain time.
* ask each participant to read a line or two that they think is interesting or worth discussing; follow the discussion from there
* ask participants to write down one or two questions or insights that they have about the works. build a discussion around these.

Here are some things to avoid:

* boring your audience with a poorly organized lecture (especially easy to do with a PPT in the "book report" style)
* asking yes or no questions: "Does Ivan Illich like schools?"
* allowing the discussion to drift too far from the texts/subject being discussed
* misjudging the time it will take to discuss something
* allowing a few voices to dominate the conversation

While most of the above comments hold for **online discussions**, there are some practical refinements.

1. You should post a video, audio, slideshow/PPT, or written introduction to the texts on the first day of the session you are leading (we are on a Wed-to-Wed schedule, so your intro should be ready by the first Wed. evening).
2. Give explicit instructions for how, what, where your classmates will post their responses
3. You are the glue that will make the online discussion work. You must read _everything_ posted, and the faster the better. Ask follow-up questions and provide comments/feedback as soon as you can. Facilitate interaction between commenters who have similar, conflicting, or overlapping ideas.

Your grade in this area will be a combination of self-, instructor-, and peer-evaluations.

### Critical Essay
Choose an area of interest that has arisen out of the course readings and discussions and write a reflective essay on this topic. Follow [Chris Higgins' Notes on the critical-interpretive essay](http://www.studyplace.org/wiki/Notes_on_the_critical-interpretive_essay) for the structure of this essay, which should be: _focused_, _interesting_, _motivated_, and _controversial_. The chapters in _Cognitive Capitalism, Education, and Digital Labor_ are typical of writing in this style. You should refer closely to the texts that we engage with during the semester in your writing. Your work must properly cite your sources. Since we will be compiling our essays together, you should use APA style. You may include endnotes in your essay as well

Essays must be approximately 5,000 words long (about 10 pages). They will be posted online for discussion in our last week of the semester. This is strictly an individual assignment (one essay per person). You should work with your study group to draft and improve your essay. I strongly suggest that everyone schedule an appointment with the [Writing Center](http://students.adelphi.edu/writingcenter/) before you turn in your draft, and then again before you turn in your final essay.

You post a **draft of your essay** on 11/21. Post your essay on Google Docs and share the link with the class (and your editor) on Moodle. You will be assigned another classmate as the editor for your work. This person will be outside of your study group, to give you a different perspective. You are encouraged to also solicit comments from your study group. **Comments on the draft you are editing are due on 11/28.**

**Your final essay is due on 12/12.** Late work will not be accepted for this assignment and there will not be an opportunity to re-write your final draft. Avail yourself to the resources in your personal learning network to ensure that you turn in high quality work.

The final essays will be **collected into an e-book and website** and published using a Creative Commons license on the Educational Technology program website as our contribution to the study of Open Education.

Your grade for the final paper will be based on the jouranl article evaluation process from the _[Journal of Peer Production](http://peerproduction.net/)_

Their reviewers consider:

1. Is the subject matter relevant?
2. Is the treatment of the subject matter intellectually interesting? _Does the author cite relevant literature to support the claims_?
3. Are there any noticeable problems with the author’s means of validating assumptions or making judgments?
4. Is the article well written?
5. Are there portions of the article that you recommend be shortened, excised or expanded?

From [Process: Appendix A](http://peerproduction.net/peer-review/process/). _modifications appear in italics_

Three people will read your essay and offer a grade and comments: the instructor, an outside reviewer, and a fellow student from the class. Your grade for the essay will be the average of these three grades.
