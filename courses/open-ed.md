## Description
Open education combines practices from Free Software development with (radically) student-centered pedagogy. In open education, free learning resources are developed collaboratively using the global internet, and tailored locally to the specific needs of learners. Students in this course study the underlying principles of open education and participate in online projects developing open educational resources.

##Goals
This course provides students an introduction to the open education movement, from a pedagogical, social, and technical perspective. Students will consider the implications of open education in the future of schools and learning, understand how to participate in open education projects, and incorporate open resources in their practice.

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Evaluate current educational practices in terms of the pedagogical goals and techniques of open education
2. Articulate the positive and negative implications of the open education movement for earning&mdash;both within and outside of schools
3. Locate and modify [open education resources](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) for their own needs
4. Contribute to open education projects

##Assignments & grading
###Class discussions
This will be a reading-heavy course. Each student will be asked to lead the discussion one week during the semester (either online, or in person).

###Wikipedia improvements

During the course, students will learn how to use MediaWiki, the software that powers Wikipedia. They will also begin to learn the cultural norms for editing and contributing to Wikipedia. They will read
Wikipedia articles related to the course topics, and edit these articles as necessary. Students wishing to challenge themselves may translate articles to or from non-English wikipedias, or contribute to the [Simple](http://simple.wikipedia.org) or non-English wikipedias.

These edits, taken as a whole, will be evaluated to see how well the students can adapt to the norms and culture of an open content community. 

###Open education contribution
_Students will choose one of the following for their final project. Projects will be evaluated using the same criteria._

####Conexions Collection

Student pairs or teams will contribute a Collection to the [Connexions](http://cnx.org) online database of learning resources. Connexions facilitates the collaborative development of free educational materials: lessons, textbooks, articles, etc.

####Wikipedia article

Students will individually or in pairs create a new Wikipedia article. They will choose an article related to Open Education that does not exist or only exists as a stub. Their goal will be to follow the Wikipedia standards to create a Feature-class article: the highest standard on Wikipedia reserved for articles that appear on the Wikipedia homepage.

_The contribution to Conexions or Wikipedia will be evaluated on the quality of the work, the significance of the contribution, and the manner with which the students interacted with the larger community._
