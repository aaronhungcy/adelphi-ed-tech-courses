Description

:   Open education combines practices from Free Software development with (radically) student-centered pedagogy. In open education, free learning resources are developed collaboratively using the global internet, and tailored locally to the specific needs of learners. Students in this course study the underlying principles of open education and participate in online projects developing open education resources.

> We need to place our action in the specific context of
> domination and liberation where we live: the network society,
> built around the communication networks of the Internet.<br />
> — Manuel Castells, _Internet Galaxy_

> Now instead the common is the
> locus of freedom and innovation—free access, free use, free expression,
> free interaction—that stands against private control, that is, the
> control exerted by private property, its legal structures, and
> its market forces. Freedom in this context can only be freedom of the common.<br />
> — Michael Hardt & Antonio Negri, _Commonwealth_

> Inevitably, this hidden curriculum of schooling adds prejudice and
> guilt to the discrimination which a society practices against some 
> of its members and compounds the privilege of others with a new 
> title to condescend to the majority. Just as inevitably, this hidden 
> curriculum serves as a ritual of initiation into a growth-oriented 
> consumer society for rich and poor alike.<br />
> — Ivan Illich, _Deschooling Society_

##Assignments & grading
###Class discussions
This will be a reading-heavy course. Each student will be asked to lead the discussion one week during the semester (either online, or in person).

###Wikipedia improvements

During the course, students will learn how to use MediaWiki, the software that powers Wikipedia. They will also begin to learn the cultural norms for editing and contributing to Wikipedia. They will read
Wikipedia articles related to the course topics, and edit these articles as necessary. Students wishing to challenge themselves may translate articles to or from non-English wikipedias, or contribute to the [Simple](http://simple.wikipedia.org) or non-English wikipedias.

These edits, taken as a whole, will be evaluated to see how well the students can adapt to the norms and culture of an open content community. 

###Open education contribution
_Students will choose one of the following for their final project. Projects will be evaluated using the same criteria._

####Conexions Collection

Student pairs or teams will contribute a Collection to the [Connexions](http://cnx.org) online database of learning resources. Connexions facilitates the collaborative development of free educational materials: lessons, textbooks, articles, etc.

####Wikipedia article

Students will individually or in pairs create a new Wikipedia article. They will choose an article related to Open Education that does not exist or only exists as a stub. Their goal will be to follow the Wikipedia standards to create a Feature-class article: the highest standard on Wikipedia reserved for articles that appear on the Wikipedia homepage.

_The contribution to Conexions or Wikipedia will be evaluated on the quality of the work, the significance of the contribution, and the manner with which the students interacted with the larger community._
