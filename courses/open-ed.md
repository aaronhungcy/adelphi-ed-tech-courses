Description

:   Open education combines practices from Free Software development with (radically) student-centered pedagogy. In open education, free learning resources are developed collaboratively using the global internet, and tailored locally to the specific needs of learners. Students in this course study the underlying principles of open education and participate in online projects developing open education resources.

> We need to place our action in the specific context of
> domination and liberation where we live: the network society,
> built around the communication networks of the Internet.<br />
> — Manuel Castells, _Internet Galaxy_

> Now instead the common is the
> locus of freedom and innovation—free access, free use, free expression,
> free interaction—that stands against private control, that is, the
> control exerted by private property, its legal structures, and
> its market forces. Freedom in this context can only be freedom of the common.<br />
> — Michael Hardt & Antonio Negri, _Commonwealth_

> Inevitably, this hidden curriculum of schooling adds prejudice and
> guilt to the discrimination which a society practices against some
> of its members and compounds the privilege of others with a new
> title to condescend to the majority. Just as inevitably, this hidden
> curriculum serves as a ritual of initiation into a growth-oriented
> consumer society for rich and poor alike.<br />
> — Ivan Illich, _Deschooling Society_

## Goals
This course provides students an introduction to the open education movement, from a pedagogical, social, and technical perspective.

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Evaluate current educational practices in terms of the pedagogical goals and techniques of open education
2. Articulate the positive and negative implications of the open education movement for earning&mdash;both within and outside of schools
3. Locate and modify [open education resources](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) for their own needs
4. Contribute to open education projects
