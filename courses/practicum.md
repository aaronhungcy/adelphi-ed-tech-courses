**School based practicum of educational technology 0858-801, Fall 2013**

**Keywords:**  educational technology specialist, ed tech practicum,
technology coordinator, student teaching, ISTE NETS

**Description:** EDT 801 is a field-based course where students put their developing
talents as educational technologists into practice in K-12 schools in
the Long Island and New York City region. Students pursuing the New York
State Educational Technology Specialist certification _must_ experience
placements in elementary (1-6) and segundary (7-12) school settings.
Additionally, at least one placement site will be in a school with a
diverse student population and one placement will be in a technology-rich
school.

Each student will work with a field-based mentor who is a regular
employee of a K-12 public school in New York State. Typically field
mentors are school or district technology coordinators, school
computer or media teachers, principals or assistant principals who have
primary responsiblities for technology planning and implementation, or
classroom teachers who fill technology leadership roles in their
schools. In addition to the field mentor, the course is led by
a university faculty supervisor.

_None._

Field-based practicum
========================================================================

Students will work in 2 different school systems during the course of 
the semester. Their placements will be sequential; you will not be
working in two sites at the same time. Students are expected to spend 10
hours each week working on projects for their sites, including at least
6 hours each week on-site. Typically, these 6 hours are completed once
a week during school hours, or twice a week during after-school hours.
Students are expected to be on-site for additional horus, as needed, to
complete their projects and per requirements by their field supervisor.

University seminar
========================================================================

During university seminars students discuss their placements, get help
on projects from faculty supervisors and cohort, and demonstrate their
progress to their peers. In Fall 2013, the cohort will meet in person
every-other-week. During intervening weeks, support and discussion
will be carried out through Moodle and other online tools.

practicing Educational Technology Specialists working in New York 
State public schools.
