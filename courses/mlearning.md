## Course description
Most of the world connects to the Internet from mobile phones. Android
tablets and iPads are filtering into schools — and the hands of
children. Students carry significant computing power in their pockets.
This course considers how mobile computing forces us to reconsider the
time and the place of learning.

</div>

As mobile networks become faster and more
ubiquitous, devices more powerful, and the internet spreading to all
corners of the world, mobile computing becomes one of the main channels
for teaching and learning. Students will learn about mobile computing in
schools, from 1:1 laptop programs to handheld computers. They will also
look at how mobile computing supports learning outside of schools, both
in K-12, higher ed, and informal settings.

## Goals & objectives
Students taking this course will develop an understanding of the ways
that mobile technologies can be used for teaching and learning. They
will also consider the impact of mobile computing on the field of
education as a whole.

Students will:

-   understand basic underlying mobile technologies, and their
    educational implications
    -   network types and capacity
    -   hardware speed, capabilities, and energy requirements
    -   screen and display technologies
    -   software development platform, including Web, SMS, and local
        “Apps”
    -   GIS and location services, and how they can be used to augment
        learning
-   understand the specific strengths and constraints of mobile
    interactivity & design
-   implement best-practices of teaching with wireless mobile technology
-   reflect on how mobile computing challenges the traditional time and
    places of learning

    
## How to use Tumblr for this course
We are going to use the social blogging software/website [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com) as our main course website this semester. Here are the basics of how we will use it:

* assignments, writing prompts, and other useful information will be posted at [mLearn AU](http://mlearnau.tumblr.com) &oumdash; the main course website
* each class member will have their own Tumblr
    - you do not have to use your own name or personally identifying information -- we will know who you are
    - you must "follow" mlearnau and all of the other members of the class
* you must check Tumblr at least once a day
* **post once, comment twice**, this will be the main online interaction for the course (i.e. what makes it blended)
    * every week you are required to post a 300+ word reading response, by the **end of day on Sunday**
    * for your reading response
        - refer closely to the reading
        - you _must_ use the tags #reading response #sessionXX where XX refers to the class session/week
    * comments are due **before class on Wednesday**
* you should try to read/post using your mobile phone and other mobile devices; some work, though, is better suited to using larger computers
* other than reading responses, you should use your blog to post links, quotes, and other mLearning related resources
* for questions about the course and support:
    - post a question on your blog, you never know who may help you out
    - for "official" support, post your question to the course site: [http://mlearnau.tumblr.com/ask](http://mlearnau.tumblr.com/ask)

**RR = Reading Response due**

**Note:** for topics where it says **mLearning in domains**, students will pursue their own self-study of how mLearning is implemented in certain domains of learning. For these weeks, you will choose your own readings (3-5 papers, about 50 pages total) and then write a reading response to those readings. You are encouraged to form study groups for these weeks, but are not required to. For example, on week 10, you may write about mobile learning and TESOL. On week 14, you might focus on mobile learning and Math.

### Reading Responses
Almost every week, you will be asked to post a _reading response_ on your Tumblr. This is the main online interaction for this blended course, and will happen most weeks &mdash; regardless of whether we are schedule to meet in person or not. Your reading response should be approximately 300-500 words, but occasionally may call for more or less.

A good reading response:

1. refers to the readings and other online activities (like video, or mobile assignments) due that week
2. it is not a _summary_, you should have a point of view and express your own synthesis, understanding, and opinion about the topic under discussion
3. sometimes will relate to courses your taking now, your work, or your personal life
4. somteimes will relate to other things you have read or studied (this is ok, just give us a little bit of refernce and a way to find out more information)
5. is not a formal, academic post (you don't need APA style references)
6. _is_ intended for this course and your classmates, though, so should be professional
7. **is posted before the end of day on Sunday, every week**

In addition to your own response, you should check Tumblr and Disqus every day. You are required to comment on at least two of your peer's responses each week. Usually you will want to respond to people who engage with you.

There are a total of 11 possible response. 10 of them will be graded (you get one free pass). You will get either 1 point or 0 points, no partial credit. Late responses will be accepted (but highly discouraged) up until Wed. Chronic late responses will bring down your grade on your professionalism rubric.

### Professionalism rubric
At the end of the semester, you will fill out a self-evaluation of your professional conduct in the class. You will be asked to reflect on:

- class attendance
- reading respons posts
- preparation and engagement with course readings
- participation in class and online discussions
- contribution to group assignments
- promptness of course materials

### Where I'm from
Using your own mobile device, create a _multimedia poem_, "Where I'm from". The poem will consist of the text and at least 5 images that you record with your phone (or tablet). 


### Tech Report
Working in groups, students will present a "Tech Report", on an aspect
of mobile technology. Groups will prepare a 10-12 minute presentation, followed by questions. They will also post an annotated list of resources (websites, press, and scholarly articles) related to their topic. Annotations should only be a few sentences.

Example topics:

* wireless networks
* near field communications (NFC)
* device hardware
* GPS & location
* iOS and Android Platforms
* mobile media (video, audio, animations, web/html/css, etc)
* speech recognition, text-to-speech
* facial recognition & computer vision
* mobile computing and assistive technology

### Mobile Video Interview
Video-capable phones and tablets have made it very easy to record video. For this assignment you are going to shoot a 5 minute video (keep it within 30 seconds of 5 min). In the video you will interview somebody (at least one person, more than one if you choose to go that way). The **theme** for the interview is: _The effect of mobile computing on our society._ You should write your interview questions before hand, but also feel free to improvise during the interview. Some interviewers edit out their own voice and questions (more of a documentary style), others leave them in (more conversational). This is entirely up to you. While you are encouraged to work with other students on the this project, everyone must upload their own interview.

Videos will be evaluated on the following scale:

* 2 points, editing: you need to edit it enough that it is smooth (no dead time, no gaps, no repeated questions, etc) and fits into the time. anything else is bonus.
* 4 points, questions: do the questions elicit interesting response from the speaker? are they thoughtful
* 2 points, appeal: was the video entertaining? would you watch another video again by this producer? did it keep you interest throughout?
* 2 points, production: could you hear the audio? was there enough light to say what was going on? was the camera steady, if meant to be steady? shaky if meant to be shaky? did you keep the subject in the frame? we're not looking for an award winning film, but something that doesn't make us strain or feel queasy.

### Mid-term essays

The instructor will post 3 essay questions related to mLearning on the course website. You will have one week to prepare your response (Wed. to Wed.). Choose two of the three essays to answer. Post two 500-800 word responses on your Tumblr. Your response should follow the standards of academic writing, referencing scholarly work and other sources to support your thesis. Please carefully proof your response before posting. Since you are writing for the web, you are encouraged to include relevant hyperlinks as well as image or other media that support your thesis. You can either use endnotes or APA formatted references for citations -- the goal is that any citation is clearly indicated and can be verified by a reader.

Example of an essay question:

> Some people view mobile learning as a "light" form of elearning or online learning: learners use the same methods and forms as other online learning, albeit the more constrained computing and physical affordances of mobile computers. Others, though, argue that the greater potential of mLearning is to rethink how and when we learn. In your opinion, which paradigm has greater potential?

### Podcasts
Podcasts show up in much of the recent literature on mobile learning as an easy way for teachers to communicate to their students and families and as a way for learners to express their ideas. During this semester, you will create 2 podcasts &mdash; an audio recording that you upload to your tumblr. The podcasts are due for sessions 10 & 12, the weeks where you will research mobile learning within a specific topic of interest to you. If you choose to work as part of a team (which is encouraged but not required) on these topics, you can submit a group podcast (where everyone in the group speaks). Group podcasts will receive the same grade, one grade for the group. Alternatively, you can work individually, or work as part of a team, but upload individual podcasts.

Your podcast must be between 8-10 minutes in length. You can, but are not required to record it on a mobile device. I usually use a laptop computer, USB headset, and [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) for my audio recordings. The target audience for this podcast is members of our class. You should assume a base understanding of both mobile technology and mobile learning. Do not assume, though, more than a general understanding of your topic (if it is specialized). It is strongly advised that you write a script and practice before creating you final recording.

Save your recording as an mp3 and upload it to your tumblr as an audio post.

This assignment is worth 10 points total, allotted according to this scale:
* content (4 points): is the content _important_? is the listener likely to learn _new information_ from this recording?
* appeal (2 points): is the podcast enjoyable and engaging? would you like to listen to another recording by this author/group? consider how things like pace, humor, voice inflection, etc contribute to the appeal of your podcast
* organization (2 points): is the podcast easy to follow? does it build in tension and details? are there important questions unanswered? is irrelevant information included? does the author properly and introduce and summarize the topic?
* clarity (2 points): make sure that recording is loud enough to hear easily, that you should speak clear, practice enough that you avoid "um" and "like", either edit out slacktime (dead air) or re-record your podcast so that it is tight

_You will lose 2 points for not uploading your podcasts on time._ You will receive zero points for this assignment if it's more than 1 day late.

### Educational App Review
"Apps", downloadable applications that run locally on a phone or tablet, you will write a review of a mobile app, from an educational perspective. Your review should be 500-800 words long. It should include the following elements:

0. introduction
1. description
    - how it works, 
    - the intended audiece
    - who publishes it
    - supporting screenshots or video
    - any other relevant information
2. review the design
    - does it follow good design principles?
    - are there any obvious limitations?
    - does it support Universal Design, accessibility, and Universal Design for Learning (UDL)?
3. discuss the educational value
    - how could/is it used for learning?
    - what would someone learn from using this app?
    - what implicit/explicit theories of learning does it embody?
        - refer to the readings: communities of practice, situated cognition, constructionism, cognitive apprenticeship, etc.
    - how does it compare to other mlearning technologies you are familiar with? again, refer to the readings and your own self-selected research
4. conclusion

Use the tag [#app-review](http://tumblr.com/tagged/app-review)

### Final project
_Choose one type of project as your final project. Projects can be completed individually or in teams._

**Mobile learning unit**

You will design a mobile learning unit. Specify your
own target audience and setting (museum, K-12, corporate training,
online/informal). Explain the technology you will use in terms of learning goals and pedagogy;
explaining why mobile technologies are a good match for what your
instructional design.

_Deliverables:_

1. Unit description
2. Learning goals
3. Lesson plans (3-5 different lessons). Lesson plans should include:
    a. materials needed for the lesson
    b. technology requirements
    c. procedures (i.e. if there's a teacher, what does the teacher do, if it's self paced, what do the students do)
    d. assessment/evaluation: how does the learner know that he or she has mastered the material?
4. Materials: any materials needed to complete the lesson

**App for learning design document**

Identify learning goals and design an app to (help) teach them. Consider how/when the app will be used and what technologies it will need (and if they are feasible). You will turn in a complete design for the app:

1. Overview
2. "User stories" (short, 2-3 sentence narrative descriptions) illustrating how your app would be used
2. Mock-ups/sketches of user interface screens
3. Diagrams showing different information flows
4. Technology report indicating the necessary technologies and considerations for implementing your app
5. A test report, from at least test session, where you ask potential users (aka friends) to try out your app -- even if they are just trying out pen and paper prototypes, you can still get useful feedback
5. (optional) any digital prototypes, artwork/design, etc

**Mobile learning literature review**

A scholarly literature review offers a complete picture of the current published research on a topic. A _good_ literature review is not just a summary of work done; it has its own thesis and synthesizes the existing body of research to formulate new hypothesis, point out discrepencies, and shed more light on the field of study.

If you choose the write a literature review, you should expect to write a 15-25 page paper in the APA format. In this field, you will probably need to analyze 15-20 different academic papers and reports to create your review. While the topic of the review is up to you, you should choose a narrow focus (touch interfaces with children) rather than a general focus (mobile learning).

**Original research**

Rather than reviewing the existing literature (above), you may choose to conduct your own research. To do this for your final, you will conceive of and execute your own research study. You will turn in a report as your final project. For your report, you can follow the standard research paper format: introduction and statement of hypothesis, review of previous work, methods, results/analysis, conclusions.

You can research a topic of your choice, but to give you a sense consider these possible topics/titles:

* Comprehension of physics concepts after play of Angry Birds in adolescent learners
* Mobile phone use in study collaboration among U.S. undergraduate students
* An ethnographic case study of middle school students use of e-textbooks

**(unofficial) fieldwork**

If you would like to work with students using mobile devices, please discuss your project idea with the instructor. There may be some schools in Brooklyn and/or Long Island we can work with, either during the school day or after school. You could possible teach a lesson and write up a report (or create a video portfolio) or do a series of observations, etc.
