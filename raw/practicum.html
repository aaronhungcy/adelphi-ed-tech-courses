         <p><strong>School based practicum of educational technology 0858-801, Fall 2013</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> educational technology specialist, ed tech practicum, technology coordinator, student teaching, ISTE NETS</p>
         <p><strong>Description:</strong> EDT 801 is a field-based course where students put their developing talents as educational technologists into practice in K-12 schools in the Long Island and New York City region. Students pursuing the New York State Educational Technology Specialist certification <em>must</em> experience placements in elementary (1-6) and segundary (7-12) school settings. Additionally, at least one placement site will be in a school with a diverse student population and one placement will be in a technology-rich school.</p>
         <p>Each student will work with a field-based mentor who is a regular employee of a K-12 public school in New York State. Typically field mentors are school or district technology coordinators, school computer or media teachers, principals or assistant principals who have primary responsiblities for technology planning and implementation, or classroom teachers who fill technology leadership roles in their schools. In addition to the field mentor, the course is led by a university faculty supervisor.</p>

         <p>Students will work in 2 different school systems during the course of the semester. Their placements will be sequential; you will not be working in two sites at the same time. Students are expected to spend 10 hours each week working on projects for their sites, including at least 6 hours each week on-site. Typically, these 6 hours are completed once a week during school hours, or twice a week during after-school hours. Students are expected to be on-site for additional horus, as needed, to complete their projects and per requirements by their field supervisor.</p>

In Fall 2013, the cohort will meet in person every-other-week. During intervening weeks, support and discussion will be carried out through Moodle and other online tools.</p>

<h3>University Statement on Academic Assistance for Students with Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you are a qualified student with a disability seeking accommodations under the Americans with Disability Act, you are required to self-identify with the Office of Disability Services, 3rd floor, University Center (516) 877-3145. Please see me at the soonest possible time for special arrangements, seating and other accommodations if necessary. At any point during the semester if you encounter difficulty with the course or feel you could be performing at a higher level, please feel free to see me.</p>

<h3>University Statement on Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>You are expected to behave with the highest level of academic integrity. Cheating and other forms of dishonesty will not be tolerated and will result in the proper disciplinary action from the university. Classroom behavior that interferes with the instructor’s ability to conduct the class or ability of students to benefit from the instruction will not be tolerated. All beepers and cellular phones should be turned off while class is in session. You are expected to come to class prepared - this means having read and studied the assigned chapters before class. By having prepared in this manner, you will be able to maximize your time spent in class.</p>
<p>Adelphi University demands the highest standards of academic integrity. Proper conduct during examinations, the proper attribution of sources in preparation of written work, and complete honesty in all academic endeavors is required. Submission of false data, falsification of grades or records, misconduct during examinations, and plagiarism are among the violations of academic integrity. Students who do not meet these standards are subject to dismissal from the University.</p>


<h3>Use of Candidate Work</h3>
<p>All teacher education programs in New York State undergo periodic reviews by accreditation agencies and the state education department. For these purposes samples of students’ work are made available to those professionals conducting the review. Student anonymity is assured under these circumstances. If you do not wish to have your work made available for these purposes, please let the professor know before the start of the second class. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.</p>
