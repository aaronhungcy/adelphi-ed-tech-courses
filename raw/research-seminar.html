         <p><br /> New Course Proposal</p>
         <p><strong>EDT 618 Research and evaluation of educational technology</strong></p>
         <p><br /> <br />  <strong>NEW COURSE NUMBER REQUESTED</strong>: EDT 618 </p>
         <p><br /><br />  <strong>NEW COURSE TITLE REQUESTED:</strong>******</p>

         <p>Curinga, Andrews, Martin</p>
         <p> <strong>CATALOG DESCRIPTION: (Limit = 50 words)</strong></p>
         <p>In this course, students investigate methods for determining if a given technology contributes to a stronger educational experience. Reviewing the body of research on educational technology, students will probe the merits of different methodologies. Students learn how to develop good research questions and choose methodologies to conduct their own investigations. (50 words)</p>

         <p> <strong>RATIONALE:</strong> </p>
         <p>This research seminar exposes students to the general methods of social science research used in education settings as well as to the specific research paradigms common to technology research. They need these skills to be effective consumers of research; to make informed technology choices and to stay abreast of current trends. Further, they will be able to develop methodologically sound frameworks to test and evaluate the effectiveness of their own technology initiatives in the field.</p>
         <p> <strong>COURSE GOALS &amp; OBJECTIVES:</strong>******</p>
         <p>This course has two main goals: 1) to develop students' abilities to read and write about scholarly research in the area of educational technology, and 2) to foster their ability to conduct academic research and less formal evaluations of educational technology.</p>
         <p>Students will be able to:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>read common statistical terms and measures (e.g. ANOVA)</p></li>
         <li><p>comprehend the major trends and questions in educational research, with a focus on technology</p></li>
         <li><p>use data mining and business intelligent techniques to spot trends in data and implement continuous improvement</p></li>
         <li><p>read and evaluate qualitative educational research</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>ethnographic approaches</p></li>
         <li><p>interviews</p></li>
         <li><p>action research and design research</p></li>
         <li><p>conversation and discourse analysis</p></li>
         <li><p>mixed methods</p></li>
         </ul></li>
         <li><p>implement online surveys</p></li>
         <li><p>use digital tools for analyzing data (spreadsheets, SPSS, SQL databases)</p></li>
         <li><p>use digital tools for visualizing and reporting numerical information</p></li>

         <p> <strong>STUDENT EVALUATION METHODS:</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Assignment 1 — Review of literature (40%)</strong></p>
         <p>Each semester, the seminar will collaboratively author a review of literature related to a major research area in educational technology. Examples of topics for the literature review:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>technology and school reform</p></li>
         <li><p>technology and special education</p></li>
         <li><p>technology and global development</p></li>
         <li><p>educational equity and technology</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>Through this assignment, students will be evaluated on their ability to understand, analyze, and synthesize research from a range of sources using a variety of research methodologies.</p>
         <p><strong>Assignment 2 — Research design</strong> <strong>(60%)</strong></p>
         <p>For the final assignment, each student will develop a novel research study to explore an area of educational technology. Students will be encouraged to develop research that they can implement in their current work positions or in their upcoming fieldwork. The research design will be evaluated on:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>the importance of the research question</p></li>
         <li><p>the clarity of the proposed study</p></li>
         <li><p>the appropriateness of the methodology chosen</p></li>
         <li><p>the feasibility of the study</p></li>

<h3>University Statement on Academic Assistance for Students with Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you are a qualified student with a disability seeking accommodations under the Americans with Disability Act, you are required to self-identify with the Office of Disability Services, 3rd floor, University Center (516) 877-3145. Please see me at the soonest possible time for special arrangements, seating and other accommodations if necessary. At any point during the semester if you encounter difficulty with the course or feel you could be performing at a higher level, please feel free to see me.</p>

<h3>University Statement on Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>You are expected to behave with the highest level of academic integrity. Cheating and other forms of dishonesty will not be tolerated and will result in the proper disciplinary action from the university. Classroom behavior that interferes with the instructor’s ability to conduct the class or ability of students to benefit from the instruction will not be tolerated. All beepers and cellular phones should be turned off while class is in session. You are expected to come to class prepared - this means having read and studied the assigned chapters before class. By having prepared in this manner, you will be able to maximize your time spent in class.</p>
<p>Adelphi University demands the highest standards of academic integrity. Proper conduct during examinations, the proper attribution of sources in preparation of written work, and complete honesty in all academic endeavors is required. Submission of false data, falsification of grades or records, misconduct during examinations, and plagiarism are among the violations of academic integrity. Students who do not meet these standards are subject to dismissal from the University.</p>


<h3>Use of Candidate Work</h3>
<p>All teacher education programs in New York State undergo periodic reviews by accreditation agencies and the state education department. For these purposes samples of students’ work are made available to those professionals conducting the review. Student anonymity is assured under these circumstances. If you do not wish to have your work made available for these purposes, please let the professor know before the start of the second class. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.</p>
