         <p>Specific teaching and learning goals include:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>designing web-based interactions and multimedia to support learning</li>
         <li>coding effective user interfaces for learning</li>
         <li>implementing Universal Design goals for accessible web sites</li>
         <li>identifying effective methods for teaching more advanced programming concepts and web design skills</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Specific software development goals include:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>modeling real world problems with software</li>
         <li>planning iterations of a project</li>
         <li>testing and debugging</li>
         <li>Object oriented programming concepts:</li>

         <p>Students in this class are given 3 open-ended challenges. The challenges become increasingly complex and are designed to scaffold students into tackling more complex analysis and programming projects. The challenges are designed to be solved in pairs. The first two challenges have an optional &quot;bonus&quot;, which is meant to give more advanced teams a challenge.</p>
         <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
         <li><strong>Word Frequency Statistics (30%)</strong><strong>:</strong> Students will parse texts to create a variety of word frequency statistics. The input text can be uploaded or submitted via a form. The results are graphically visualized using HTML.</li>
         <li><strong>Photo gallery (30%)</strong><strong>:</strong> students will enter the world of Web-based APIs and interactive web programming by rethinking a familiar online idiom, the photo gallery. Using the Flickr API, they will create their own gallery software. <em>Bonus</em>: use the jQuery javascript library to add visual effects to your gallery.</li>
         <li><strong>Final project (40%):</strong> student teams will propose, design, and execute their own project. The requirements for the project are that it demonstrates effective use of the web for supporting learning, as well as the student's understanding of software analysis and design. The instructor will work with teams to develop suitable projects. In addition to submitting the working code, students will turn in a one page paper reflecting on the pedagogy informing their design.</li>

<h3>University Statement on Academic Assistance for Students with Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you are a qualified student with a disability seeking accommodations under the Americans with Disability Act, you are required to self-identify with the Office of Disability Services, 3rd floor, University Center (516) 877-3145. Please see me at the soonest possible time for special arrangements, seating and other accommodations if necessary. At any point during the semester if you encounter difficulty with the course or feel you could be performing at a higher level, please feel free to see me.</p>

<h3>University Statement on Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>You are expected to behave with the highest level of academic integrity. Cheating and other forms of dishonesty will not be tolerated and will result in the proper disciplinary action from the university. Classroom behavior that interferes with the instructor’s ability to conduct the class or ability of students to benefit from the instruction will not be tolerated. All beepers and cellular phones should be turned off while class is in session. You are expected to come to class prepared - this means having read and studied the assigned chapters before class. By having prepared in this manner, you will be able to maximize your time spent in class.</p>
<p>Adelphi University demands the highest standards of academic integrity. Proper conduct during examinations, the proper attribution of sources in preparation of written work, and complete honesty in all academic endeavors is required. Submission of false data, falsification of grades or records, misconduct during examinations, and plagiarism are among the violations of academic integrity. Students who do not meet these standards are subject to dismissal from the University.</p>


<h3>Use of Candidate Work</h3>
<p>All teacher education programs in New York State undergo periodic reviews by accreditation agencies and the state education department. For these purposes samples of students’ work are made available to those professionals conducting the review. Student anonymity is assured under these circumstances. If you do not wish to have your work made available for these purposes, please let the professor know before the start of the second class. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.</p>
