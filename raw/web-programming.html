<article><p><strong>EDT 603 <em>Programming web-based educational media</em>, Spring 2013</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Description:</strong> In this course students learn techniques of web programming to develop interactive, educational media. Using the Python programming language and web development technologies (HTML5, Javascript, CSS), students gain practice in the object oriented programming and design of interactive software. For their final project, students will create their own educational website.</p>

         <h2><a href="#TOC">Course Format</a></h2>
         <p>This course is fully online. Each week there will be a series of topics, for students to pursue at their own pace. Weeks will run on a Monday-to-Monday schedule. Assignments for the week are due on the following Monday.</p>
         <p>This course runs on the Cycle 3 schedule. It begins on Monday January 27 and ends on Monday March 18.</p>
         <p>Instruction will come from several sources:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>the course text book (Duckett)</li>
         <li>web resources, especially Code Academy</li>
         <li>instructor videos</li>
         </ul>
         <p>There will be instructor led labs during office hours every week, both online via Google Hangout and in-person on the Garden City campus.</p>
         <p>Students <em>must</em> attend at least 4 lab sessions. Assignments will be posted to this wiki and other communications will be sent via the Google Group Email List -- <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/au-web-programming">Adelphi Web Programming</a></p>

         <h2><a href="#TOC">Goals and Objectives</a></h2>
         <p>This course builds on CSC 602 to move beyond basic programming concepts; students will gain expertise in building more complex computer programs, over many iterations. At the end of the course, students will be able to design educationally sound web-based learning media, solve moderately complex problems using OOP, collaborate on programming projects, and identify methods for teaching programming and web development.</p>
         <p>Specific teaching and learning goals include:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>designing web-based interactions and multimedia to support learning<br /></li>
         <li>coding effective user interfaces for learning</li>
         <li>implementing Universal Design goals for accessible web sites</li>
         <li>identifying effective methods for teaching more advanced programming concepts and web design skills</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Specific software development goals include:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>modeling real world problems with software</li>
         <li>planning iterations of a project</li>
         <li>testing and debugging</li>
         <li>Object oriented programming concepts:</li>
         <li>Abstraction</li>
         <li>Encapsulation</li>
         <li>Objects &amp; Classes</li>
         <li>Composition</li>

         <p>Students are expected to be active participants in the course, communicating via email, posting to the wiki, and completing assignments in a timely manner. The course instructors will base the participation grade on the quality and timeliness of their participation in the course.</p>

         <h3><a href="#TOC">Improvement (15%)</a></h3>
         <p>The two coding projects will be based on mastery of the skills of web development. Because students come to the course with different skill sets, part of their final assessment will be based on their improvement. In the first week of the course, students will post a short, narrative self-assessment of their web programming skills: HTML, CSS, Javascript, (Python or other) Programming, and general understanding of how the Interent and Web work.</p>
         <p>At the end of the semester, each student will email the instructors with an updated assessment and the grade they think they deserve for their improvement.</p>

         <p>Students will build a single-page, informational website on a topic of their choice. Their website will be composed of HTML, CSS, and (optionally) Javascript. It will display their fluency with the components of HTML, styling with CSS, and enhancing user experience with Javascript. The content of the website is entirely up to the student. They are encouraged to create a website on something they are already familiar with and interested in. This is an individual project.</p>

         <p>Student teams will propose, design, and execute a project. The project can be completed individually, or in a 2-person team. The requirements for the project are that it demonstrates the students understanding of server-side and client-side web development. The instructor will work with teams to develop suitable projects.</p>

<h3>University Statement on Academic Assistance for Students with Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you are a qualified student with a disability seeking accommodations under the Americans with Disability Act, you are required to self-identify with the Office of Disability Services, 3rd floor, University Center (516) 877-3145. Please see me at the soonest possible time for special arrangements, seating and other accommodations if necessary. At any point during the semester if you encounter difficulty with the course or feel you could be performing at a higher level, please feel free to see me.</p>

<h3>University Statement on Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>You are expected to behave with the highest level of academic integrity. Cheating and other forms of dishonesty will not be tolerated and will result in the proper disciplinary action from the university. Classroom behavior that interferes with the instructor’s ability to conduct the class or ability of students to benefit from the instruction will not be tolerated. All beepers and cellular phones should be turned off while class is in session. You are expected to come to class prepared - this means having read and studied the assigned chapters before class. By having prepared in this manner, you will be able to maximize your time spent in class.</p>
<p>Adelphi University demands the highest standards of academic integrity. Proper conduct during examinations, the proper attribution of sources in preparation of written work, and complete honesty in all academic endeavors is required. Submission of false data, falsification of grades or records, misconduct during examinations, and plagiarism are among the violations of academic integrity. Students who do not meet these standards are subject to dismissal from the University.</p>


<h3>Use of Candidate Work</h3>
<p>All teacher education programs in New York State undergo periodic reviews by accreditation agencies and the state education department. For these purposes samples of students’ work are made available to those professionals conducting the review. Student anonymity is assured under these circumstances. If you do not wish to have your work made available for these purposes, please let the professor know before the start of the second class. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.</p>
