<h2><a href="#TOC">Description</a></h2>
<p>How can the digital media best support learning? Working on semester-long projects, students learn about interaction and instructional design. In this hands-on studio, develop and extend skills in multimedia authoring: digital images/audio/video, web design, HTML/CSS/Javascript, web programming. Apply these skills to create a original educational resources.</p>
<p>Each semester will feature a different challenge, dealing with an important, global topic. Students will be asked to work on a semester long multimedia project that teaches some aspect of this challenge. The semester will culminate with a student show, which will be refereed by a panel of experts in the field of educational technology.</p>
<p>Since I started thinking about this course in Fall 2010, I have thought about what topics would make good subjects. Here is what I've been thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fall 2010: Teaching the BP Oil Spill</li>
<li>Spring 2011: Wikileaks: diplomacy, journalism, and the internet</li>
<li>Fall 2011: The Arab Spring</li>
<li>Spring 2012: #Occupy</li>
</ul>
<p>All final projects will be published on the Program in Educational Technology website, and will be released under an appropriate open license that allows reuse and remix (GPL for code, CC for creative works, for example).</p>

<h2><a href="#TOC">Goals</a></h2>
<p>This course is designed to challenge students to develop their abilities as instructional designers and as authors and producers of digital media for learning. Specifically, they should learn to:</p>
<ul>
<li>design an effective digital learning environment that is intuitive to use and follows principles of Universal Design for Learning</li>
<li>develop in-depth skill in one area of digital production: video editing, graphic design, game design, computer programming, web design, etc.</li>
<li>understand key concepts of instructional design, including meeting the needs of the target audience and following sound and ethical pedagogical principles</li>
<li>think creatively about far-reaching challenges in teaching and learning</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="#TOC">Assignments</a></h2>
<p>The studio format allows for frequent and ongoing evaluation of the student work. An important aspect will be invited guests who will also come into the studio to consult with students and to offer informal feedback. There will be formal mid-point and final critiques. The mid-point critique will be conducted by the instructor and a guest; the final assessment will consist of a panel of distinguished judges from Adelphi University and outside organizations.</p>
<ul>
<li>initial proposal (15%)</li>
<li>mid-term critique (20%)</li>

<div class="section level3" id="design">
<h3><a href="#TOC">Design</a></h3>
<p>The design of the project encompasses the information, interaction, and media design. Points to consider when evaluating the design:</p>
<ul>
<li>is the navigation consistent, logical, and easily understood?</li>
<li>does the graphic design engage users?</li>
<li>does the look and feel support the learning goals of the project?</li>
<li>does the user interface take advantage of existing conventions, UI widgets, and user patterns?</li>
<li>are there clear paths through the system to accomplish user goals?</li>
<li>are system messages and instructions consistent and clear?</li>
<li>does the overall design exhibit a level of professionalism and polish that supports trust by the user?</li>
<li>is the design accessible?
<ul>
<li>does it support the widest possible range of computer systems (including OS, web browser, screen size/mobile, processor speed, internet connection quality)</li>
<li>can it be accessed by users with disabilities, where appropriate?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3" id="technique">
<h3><a href="#TOC">Technique</a></h3>
<p>The project's technique reflects the proficiency of the teams with the tools of the digital studio. All aspects of the project should be well tested for smooth operation. Users should not easily &quot;break&quot; the system. The specifics of development depend on the media. So, each of the various skills required for the course will be evaluated based on the practice of expert practitioners.</p>
<ul>
<li>is video composed and edited like an expert video?</li>
<li>does software meet the speed and reliability that an expert would expect?</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section level3" id="originality-innovation">
<h3><a href="#TOC">Originality &amp; innovation</a></h3>
<p>Teams will gain points based on the originality of their project. Does the project take a novel approach to teaching with digital media? Does it combine existing practices in new ways, for a new effect?</p>
<p>Students will lose points in originality for verbatim translating of existing learning solutions to the new problem space.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3" id="learning-science">
<h3><a href="#TOC">Learning science</a></h3>
<p>At the end, this studio challenge is about learning. Points in this category are awarded for exhibiting a thorough understanding of how people learn with digital artifacts. Successful projects will account for the cognitive, social, pragmatic, ethical, and aesthetic implications of their design, as it impacts learning.</p>
