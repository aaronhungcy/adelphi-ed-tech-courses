<div id="description">
<h2><a href="#TOC">Description</a></h2>
<p>How do multimedia, texting, chat, status updates, and hypertext change the way we read and interpret texts? Students study various theories of literacy and how it changes with the introduction of digital technologies. Readings will include selections on new media, new literacy, multiliteracies, multimedia cognition, and visual semantics.</p>
<p>This foundational course provides students a conceptual framework to critically interpret digital media, and to author powerful and effective digital documents. Students have the opportunity to practice and develop these skills, which are central to many aspects of the degree in <a href="http://education.adelphi.edu/ed-tech">Educational Technology</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="goals-and-objectives">
<h2><a href="#TOC">Goals and objectives</a></h2>
<p>Two overarching goals drive this course. First, students should understand the literacy skills required to critically interpret digital texts. Second, they should learn how to communicate effectively using the tools and techniques of digital media. More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students will develop a conception of &quot;digital literacy&quot; as a multifaceted, social process of decoding audio and visual symbols and signals.</li>
<li>Students will gain a familiarity with a range of research perspectives which engage with digital literacy.</li>
<li>Students will refine their understanding of the affordances of a range of media, and these features' implications for literacy.</li>
<li>Students will confront and assess their own preconceived ideas about technology skills and how learners acquire them.</li>
<li>Students will be able to create a variety of digital texts to communicate in different genres and for multiple purposes.</li>
<li>Students will be able to articulate the cultural and political implications of digital communications, with attention to concerns of power and equity online and in classrooms.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="#TOC">Assignments</a></h2>
<p>Students will complete a variety of in-class and homework assignments that ask them to reflect on the theories of digital literacy and to effectively use digital tools to create new media texts. The following assignments will allow the instructor to evaluate their progress.</p>
<p><strong>Slideshow presentation: my tech biography.</strong> In this assignments students will reflect on their history of interacting with and learning digital technologies. They will be responsible for creating a multimedia slideshow on the topic. Both the contents of the slideshow and the skills exhibited by the students will allow the instructor to gauge their facility with producing digital media. (15%)</p>
<p><strong>Semantic map: digital literacies landscape.</strong> Students will create a semantic map which shows the varied skills and contexts required to be considered <em>fully literate</em> in the networked society. They will have to identify major and minor areas of literacy and indicate how they are related to each other. This assignment will allow the instructor to evaluate how well the students can synthesize the course readings explaining the digital literacy landscape. (15%)</p>
<p><strong>Diamond Age reaction paper.</strong> After completing Diamond Age students will write a short (~1500 word) paper reacting to the educational technology in the novel.
