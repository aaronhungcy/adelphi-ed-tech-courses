<p><br /><br />  <strong>MODE OF DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Check all envisioned currently:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Traditional (0-29% content on-line)</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Blended (30-79% content on-line)</strong></p>
<p> <strong>On-line (80+% content on-line)</strong> ****</p>
<hr />
<p> <strong>STUDENT EVALUATION METHODS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class Participation (15%)</strong></p>
<p>Students will be assessed on quality and depth of class discussions, as carried out through synchronous and asynchronous online activities. Class participation will be based on weekly session topics and collaborative work with class members.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Reflection/Response Papers (50%)</strong></p>
<p>Students will be asked to respond to a special topic or issues related to weekly topics by way of a reflection paper. The instructor will review these papers to evaluate student mastery of the course goals, and will provide written feedback to indicate how students can improve their reflection as the semester progresses.</p>
<p><em>Sample questions for reflective papers:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>(session 2)</strong>Which types of students do you think benefit the most for <em>asynchronous</em> online classes, where students do not need to “meet” online/virtually at any set time? Which type of learners would find this format the most challenging?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>(Session 3)</strong> Can students learn core content at anytime and at anyplace? Do you think it is best that they learn this content outside of the classroom or within the classroom? What are the challenges of maintaining a quality education as learning is moved beyond the physical classroom?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>(session 7)</strong> Would you like to attend a fully virtual school, as a student? Would you like to work in one as a teacher? Referring to the cases we have read about, explain why or why not.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>(session 9)</strong> As a current or future teacher, what do you think are the challenges of supporting robust collaboration and professional development when working in a primarily online or virtual school?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final Culminating Project (35%)</strong></p>
<p>Students will write a design plan for implementation of an online, blended or virtual program.

<h3>University Statement on Academic Assistance for Students with Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you are a qualified student with a disability seeking accommodations under the Americans with Disability Act, you are required to self-identify with the Office of Disability Services, 3rd floor, University Center (516) 877-3145. Please see me at the soonest possible time for special arrangements, seating and other accommodations if necessary. At any point during the semester if you encounter difficulty with the course or feel you could be performing at a higher level, please feel free to see me.</p>

<h3>University Statement on Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>You are expected to behave with the highest level of academic integrity. Cheating and other forms of dishonesty will not be tolerated and will result in the proper disciplinary action from the university. Classroom behavior that interferes with the instructor’s ability to conduct the class or ability of students to benefit from the instruction will not be tolerated. All beepers and cellular phones should be turned off while class is in session. You are expected to come to class prepared - this means having read and studied the assigned chapters before class. By having prepared in this manner, you will be able to maximize your time spent in class.</p>
<p>Adelphi University demands the highest standards of academic integrity. Proper conduct during examinations, the proper attribution of sources in preparation of written work, and complete honesty in all academic endeavors is required. Submission of false data, falsification of grades or records, misconduct during examinations, and plagiarism are among the violations of academic integrity. Students who do not meet these standards are subject to dismissal from the University.</p>


<h3>Use of Candidate Work</h3>
<p>All teacher education programs in New York State undergo periodic reviews by accreditation agencies and the state education department. For these purposes samples of students’ work are made available to those professionals conducting the review. Student anonymity is assured under these circumstances. If you do not wish to have your work made available for these purposes, please let the professor know before the start of the second class. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.</p>
